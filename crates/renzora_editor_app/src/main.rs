//! The editor executable.
//!
//! Deliberately much smaller than the runtime's `main.rs`. That binary has to
//! decide at startup whether it is a game, a dedicated server, a listen server
//! or a VR session; this one is only ever the editor. The editor launches the
//! *runtime* binary as a child process for Play, so it never needs those modes
//! itself.
//!
//! The editor arrives by a plain function call rather than `dlopen`. With Bevy
//! statically linked there is no shared `bevy_dylib` for a loadable bundle to
//! attach to — a cdylib linking static Bevy would carry a second copy of Bevy,
//! and therefore a second `World` type, so every component crossing the boundary
//! would mismatch. "Editor as a removable file" becomes "editor as a separate
//! executable"; removing editor code from a shipped game is now a property of
//! which binary you ship, not of which files you delete beside it.
