//! The first-run setup window: a progress bar, shown before the editor exists.
//!
//! A downloaded release has to unpack the SDK and compile its native plugins
//! before the editor can load them, and that takes a few seconds. Doing it
//! silently would look like a hang — the window simply would not appear — so
//! this puts up a small window that says what is happening.
//!
//! # Why this is its own Bevy `App`
//!
//! The work has to finish before [`renzora_native_plugin::NativePluginLoader`]
//! runs, and that runs during the *editor's* `App` assembly. So there is no
//! editor `App` to draw into yet, and the splash — which is the natural place
//! for "getting ready" — comes later still.
//!
//! A second, tiny `App` is the way out: bare `DefaultPlugins`, one window, two
//! nodes. It runs, finishes, and the process restarts into the ordinary editor
//! with everything in place. Nothing here uses `renzora_ember`, deliberately —
//! the theme, fonts and stylesheet all live behind engine plugins this app does
//! not have, and pulling them in would make setup depend on most of the thing it
//! exists to set up.
//!
//! # Why the work runs on a thread
//!
//! `prebuild::run` is blocking: it decompresses ~1.9 GB and then drives `rustc`
//! once per plugin. On the main thread the window would freeze for the whole
//! duration and Windows would grey it out as "not responding" — the exact
//! impression the bar exists to avoid. It runs on a plain `std::thread` and
//! publishes progress through a mutex the render loop samples each frame.
