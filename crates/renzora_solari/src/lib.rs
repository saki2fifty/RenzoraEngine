//! Renzora Solari — hardware-raytraced global illumination, as a drop-in plugin.
//!
//! Wraps Bevy's experimental `bevy_solari` (`SolariPlugins`: realtime raytraced
//! direct + indirect lighting, fully dynamic, no baking) behind Renzora's plugin
//! contract. Ships as a `cdylib` in `plugins/` like `renzora_lumen` — drop it in
//! to enable Solari, delete it to disable. Nothing in the host references this
//! crate.
//!
//! ## Why this needs a host capability flag
//!
//! Solari requires ray-tracing wgpu features (`EXPERIMENTAL_RAY_QUERY` +
//! acceleration structures) enabled on the `RenderDevice` *at creation time*.
//! That is frozen before any dlopen plugin's `build()` runs, so this plugin
//! cannot turn them on itself. The host (`renzora_runtime`) probes the GPU at
//! startup, requests the features when supported, and records the result in
//! [`renzora::GpuRaytracing`]. We read that here and install `SolariPlugins`
//! ONLY when ray tracing is available — otherwise adding RT render nodes on an
//! incapable GPU would crash the engine. Flag absent/false ⇒ inert (warn +
//! no-op) so the engine still boots on non-RT GPUs with the plugin present.
//!
//! ## Authoring
//!
//! [`renzora::SolariGi`] is authored on the "World Environment" source entity
//! and routed to cameras via [`renzora::EffectRouting`] (same mechanism as
//! `LumenLighting`). While enabled we attach Bevy's `SolariLighting` to each
//! routed camera (which pulls in the required HDR + prepass components) with
//! `Msaa::Off`, and mirror every *conforming* mesh into the ray-tracing scene
//! via `RaytracingMesh3d`. Solari's BLAS builder rejects meshes that lack
//! tangents/UVs or use 16-bit indices, so non-conforming meshes are skipped
//! (and marked so we don't re-check them every frame) rather than crashing.
//!
//! ## What gets mirrored, and why the filter is not optional
//!
//! Bevy's ray-tracing scene has no notion of visibility or render layers:
//! `prepare_raytracing_scene_bindings` puts *every* entity carrying
//! `RaytracingMesh3d` into the TLAS at full ray mask. The editor, meanwhile,
//! keeps a lot of geometry in the same `World` that the viewport never shows —
//! offscreen thumbnail/preview rigs and gizmo meshes, separated only by
//! `RenderLayers` — so mirroring indiscriminately turns all of it into invisible
//! shadow casters standing in the middle of the level. See
//! [`in_raytraced_scene`].
