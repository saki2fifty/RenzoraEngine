//! Software updates for the editor.
//!
//! Checks GitHub for a newer engine, downloads the `<platform>.zip` for this
//! host, and hands the swap to the `renzora-update` sidecar (`tools/updater`),
//! because a running executable cannot replace itself.
//!
//! # What this replaced
//!
//! An updater existed before and was removed in the alpha-5 restructure. Its
//! version comparator was worth keeping and is recovered in [`version`], tests
//! included. The rest could not be: it replaced a **single `.exe`**, and an
//! install stopped being one file when the editor and runtime split into two
//! binaries with `plugins/` beside them — never mind that Linux ships one
//! `.AppImage` and macOS one `.app`. Its UI was also egui, and the editor is
//! bevy_ui now. So the shape of the swap ([`install`]) and the whole dialog
//! ([`native`]) are new; the sidecar keeps the old one's structure and fixes its
//! macOS process-wait, which polled `/proc` on a system that has no `/proc`.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! `auto` (the default) follows the build: a nightly build is offered newer
//! nightlies, a released build is offered releases, and a build from source
//! tracks nightlies. `stable`/`nightly` override it. See
//! [`check::UpdateChannel`].
//!
//! **Nightlies are gated on developer mode.** With the toggle off every
//! preference resolves to `stable`, because a nightly is last night's `main` and
//! nobody who is just using the editor should be nudged onto one — least of all
//! by a chip in the top bar. The stored preference survives the gate, so turning
//! dev mode back on restores it.
//!
//! # Skipping a version
//!
//! "Skip This Version" records one tag in `~/.renzora/editor.toml` and silences
//! the top bar's chip (and the Help menu's "Update to …") for it. One tag, not a
//! list: skipping means "not this one", and the next release asks again. The
//! dialog still lists a skipped version — someone who opened the dialog is
//! asking — and downloading it clears the skip.
//!
//! # Running from a source checkout
//!
//! The editor then lives in `<checkout>/dist/<platform>/`, so installing a
//! release replaces the tree `cargo renzora` stages into — recoverable by
//! rebuilding, but never something to do on one stray click.
//! [`install::detect_layout`] notices, and the dialog makes you say it twice:
//! the action button reads "Overwrite dist/…", arms on the first click, and only
//! installs on the second, naming the exact directory in between. Downloading is
//! never gated — it writes to `~/.renzora/updates/`, not to the install.
//!
//! # Install path
//!
//! The dialog exposes where the swap lands, pre-filled with the directory this
//! binary is running from — the detected default, and the right answer almost
//! always. Retargeting re-derives everything that depends on the path (which
//! binary to relaunch, and whether the destination is a checkout), so pointing
//! the install away from `dist/` genuinely drops the overwrite confirmation
//! rather than only moving the files.
