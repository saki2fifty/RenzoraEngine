//! The editor — every editor-only plugin crate, linked as rlibs and installed
//! by [`install`].
//!
//! This crate is what makes the editor removable. `renzora.exe` links only
//! `renzora_runtime`; `renzora-editor.exe` links this crate on top. Same engine,
//! two binaries, and a shipped game carries none of the editor.
//!
//! It is a loadable image again. It was one until Bevy went static — a bundle
//! has to share the host's Bevy, and with Bevy linked into each binary there was
//! no shared copy to attach to, so the bundle became a second executable. Bevy
//! is a shared image once more, so the boundary is sound again.
//!
//! # What is and is not shared
//!
//! `bevy_dylib`, `renzora_dylib` and `renzora_ember_dylib` are shared because
//! those crates keep **process-global statics** — the translation table, the
//! Console and Problems buffers, the theme palette and stylesheet — that must be
//! one thing per process or they fail silently.
//!
//! The other crates this image and the executable both depend on are simply
//! linked into each. That costs bytes and nothing else: a `TypeId` comes from a
//! crate's stable id, not from which artifact swallowed it, so both sides agree
//! about what a component is even with two copies of the code. It is the same
//! arrangement every native plugin already runs under.
//!
//! Third-party extensions are C-ABI plugins (`renzora_plugin`), which link no
//! Bevy at all and so have never had this constraint.

// Linked for their side effect only — see the dependency comment in
// `Cargo.toml`. Their presence is what makes `renzora` and `renzora_ember`
// resolve to the shared images instead of being embedded here, which is what
// keeps the translation table, the Console buffers and the theme palette one
// thing per process rather than one per image.
