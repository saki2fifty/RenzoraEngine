//! The whole chain, end to end: `fetch` on a background thread → the queue →
//! the frame pump → an `extern "C"` call into a backend → its events → back to
//! the parked thread.
//!
//! Every piece of this is unit-tested on its own, and none of that would have
//! caught the failure this exists for: the pieces agreeing about the *protocol*
//! but not about the *choreography*. A backend that answers on the same frame it
//! was started, a terminal event that never arrives, a waiter registered after
//! the pump already looked — each leaves a thread parked forever and every
//! individual test still green.
//!
//! The backend here is a real one as far as the boundary is concerned: it is
//! reached through `NetEntry`, a bare `extern "C"` function pointer, with the
//! request encoded and the events decoded by the same codec a `dlopen`'d plugin
//! would use. What it is *not* is networked — it answers from a table, so the
//! test has no sockets in it and cannot flake.
