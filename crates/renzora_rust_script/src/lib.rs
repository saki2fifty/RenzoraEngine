//! Rust scripts: per-entity native code, compiled from the project, with the
//! same `&mut World` an exclusive system gets.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // <project>/scripts/spin.rs
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn update(world: &mut World, me: Entity) {
//!     let dt = world.resource::<Time>().delta_secs();
//!     if let Some(mut t) = world.get_mut::<Transform>(me) {
//!         t.rotate_y(dt);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! renzora::script!(update);
//! ```
//!
//! Attached exactly like a Lua script: drop it into the entity's **Scripts**
//! component. Routing is by file extension, the same way `.lua`, `.blueprint`
//! and `.bp` already route.
//!
//! Everything Bevy allows is allowed: spawn hierarchies, build UI, insert
//! components, swap materials, reach other entities by [`Entity`]. There is no
//! vocabulary in the way, because the script and the engine share one Bevy.
//!
//! # How this fits the scripting layer, and where it does not
//!
//! A backend normally returns [`ScriptCommand`]s for a queue to apply — safe,
//! interchangeable, and exactly what a Rust script does not want. So this crate
//! splits the two halves a backend usually does together:
//!
//! * [`backend::RustScriptBackend`] **claims** `.rs`, so the Scripts component
//!   accepts one and the execution loop does not flag it as broken.
//! * [`dispatch`] **runs** it, from an exclusive system with the real world.
//!
//! # A script IS a native plugin
//!
//! Not "like one" — the same thing, built by the same compiler driver against
//! the same SDK. The only difference is the convention: a plugin exports a
//! `Plugin` and installs once, a script exports a per-entity function called for
//! each entity carrying it. So the limits are the plugin limits, not new ones —
//! see `crates/renzora_native_plugin`.
//!
//! # Reloading
//!
//! Saving a script rebuilds it, off the main thread, and swaps the function
//! pointer — see [`watch`]. Every reload leaks the old image, because a schedule
//! or a captured closure may still hold pointers into it; a restart reclaims it.
//!
//! # What is not solved yet
//!
//! **Nothing in a lean export.** A static build links no shared images, so a
//! script library has nothing to bind to. The answer is to compile scripts INTO
//! the export, which the lean exporter is already shaped for.
//!
//! **No props.** Lua declares tunables in a table the backend parses; the Rust
//! equivalent is reading attributes off the source. Until then, a script's
//! tunables are ordinary components on the entity, which the inspector already
//! edits.
