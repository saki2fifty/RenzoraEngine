/// - `WinitPlugin` disabled + `ScheduleRunnerPlugin` added — winit's event loop
///   fails to initialize on a headless Linux box (no X/Wayland), even with no
///   window. Dropping it and driving the app with a fixed-rate runner is what
///   makes the server actually deployable on a bare cloud VM.
///
/// This mirrors Godot's `--headless` (full renderer present, no driver active).
/// Plugins that touch the render sub-app must guard for its absence
/// (`get_sub_app_mut(RenderApp)`), exactly as Bevy's own render plugins do.

/// `tick_rate` (Hz) sets the runner's loop rate; it matches the network tick so
/// the server loop runs at the simulation cadence.

///
/// Mirrors [`add_default_rendering`]'s asset/image/log configuration but hands
/// render-plugin ownership to `bevy_mod_openxr` via [`renzora_xr::xr_plugins`]:
/// the OpenXR runtime dictates the graphics device, spawns the per-eye stereo
/// cameras targeting its swapchain, and drives frame pacing. Differences from
/// the flat path, each deliberate:
///
/// - **No `RenderPlugin`/`platform_wgpu_settings`** — device creation goes
///   through OpenXR; requesting our custom wgpu features there would need
///   `OxrInitPlugin` plumbing (future work; POLYGON_MODE_LINE debug wireframes
///   are simply absent in VR until then).
/// - **`PipelinedRenderingPlugin` disabled** — pipelining renders poses located
///   a frame earlier; in-headset that reads as the world lagging your head.
/// - **No render-error recovery** — the flat path's `DeviceLost` recovery
///   recreates a NON-XR renderer, which would silently drop out of the
///   headset; better to exit and let the user relaunch into VR.
/// - **`GpuRaytracing` forced off** — solari + VR frame budgets don't mix, and
///   the probe in `raytracing_supported()` describes a device we didn't create.
/// - Always a game session (`--vr` implies `--no-editor`), so the runtime
///   window-config systems apply as usual to the desktop mirror window.
