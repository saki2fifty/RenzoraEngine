//! Load the editor, if it is there.
//!
//! One binary, two roles. `renzora_editor.<dll|so|dylib>` beside the executable
//! makes it the editor; without the file the same executable is the game. So
//! "ship without the editor" is deleting one file rather than building and
//! shipping a different binary, and a game and an editor are never two things
//! that can drift apart.
//!
//! # Why this is sound
//!
//! The image links the real Bevy and takes `&mut App` across a `dlopen`
//! boundary, which is only safe while both sides agree on what `App` is.
//! `bevy_dylib` is what makes that true, exactly as it does for a native plugin;
//! `renzora_dylib` and `renzora_ember_dylib` do the same for the contract
//! crate's and the UI toolkit's process-global statics.
//!
//! Crates the executable and the image both depend on are linked into each, and
//! that is fine: a `TypeId` comes from a crate's stable id rather than from
//! which artifact swallowed it, so both sides agree about what a component is
//! even with two copies of the code. The executable IS the runtime — it carries
//! the engine as it always did, and this image adds the editor on top.
//!
//! There is no version handshake, and it would not help: by the time anything
//! could be inspected the damage is done. What makes it safe in practice is that
//! the executable and the image come out of the same `cargo build --workspace`
//! and are staged together — cargo rebuilds both when a shared crate changes.
//!
//! # Why the image is never unloaded
//!
//! Same rule the plugin loaders follow, for the same reason. `Library::new` runs
//! the image's static initializers and the editor registers systems, resources
//! and function pointers into the `App`; unmapping it would leave every one of
//! those dangling, and `FreeLibrary` on a warmed Rust dylib inside the loader
//! lock is the deadlock `renzora_plugin`'s loader hit twice. The image is held
//! for the life of the process.
