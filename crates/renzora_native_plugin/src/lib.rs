//! Loads **native plugins** — Bevy plugins shipped as Rust source and compiled
//! on the machine that installs them, rebuilt whenever the engine moves.
//!
//! "Native" as in *native API*: one of these links the real Bevy and the real
//! contract crate, so it takes `&mut World`, calls `app.add_systems`, and sees
//! the same `Transform` the engine does. The C-ABI plugins in `renzora_plugin`
//! are equally native *code* — the distinction is that they share no types and
//! reach the engine through a fixed function table instead.
//!
//! # Both kinds live in `plugins/`, and neither loader needs to know
//!
//! To a user they are all just plugins, and the directory reflects that. The two
//! loaders never collide because both are symbol-dispatched and they do not even
//! look at the same shape of thing: the C-ABI loader does a non-recursive
//! `read_dir` filtered to the library extension, so a plugin *directory* is
//! invisible to it, while this one only considers directories containing
//! `src/lib.rs`. A built library sits under `<name>/build/`, one level below
//! anything the C-ABI scan reaches.
//!
//! ```text
//! <exe dir>/
//!   bevy_dylib-<hash>.dll   renzora_dylib.dll     the shared images
//!   sdk/                                          blueprints, optional
//!   plugins/
//!     grayscale.dll                               C-ABI: prebuilt, 52 KB
//!     lua.dll                                     C-ABI
//!     spin-thing/                                 native: shipped as source
//!       src/lib.rs                                  what the marketplace sent
//!       build/spin_thing.dll                        what rustc produced
//!       build/stamp.txt                             what it was built against
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the C-ABI mechanism is still needed
//!
//! Not a missing feature — a structural difference. A native plugin links the
//! shared `bevy_dylib` and `renzora_dylib`; a lean export drops
//! `dynamic_linking` and has neither, so a shipped game cannot load one, and nor
//! can wasm or mobile where dylibs do not exist at all. A C-ABI plugin links no
//! Bevy, is tens of KB, loads into any build, and can be linked *into* a static
//! binary via `static_plugins` — which is how `plugins/lua` reaches a shipped
//! game.
//!
//! So a native plugin extends the editor with full ECS access; a C-ABI plugin
//! ships inside the game. Two mechanisms because there are two deployments.
//!
//! # Why a stamp instead of trusting the file
//!
//! A plugin is bound to one engine build. Its crate metadata, its `TypeId`s
//! and its imports all come from artifacts whose filenames hash the build
//! configuration, so a plugin built against a different engine is not "probably
//! fine" — it is memory corruption with no diagnostic. There is no handshake to
//! catch it either: the boundary is a plain Rust `fn() -> Box<dyn Plugin>`, with
//! nothing to negotiate.
//!
//! So each build records what it was built against, and load compares. A
//! mismatch rebuilds (a second, and invisible) rather than loading. This is the
//! property that makes source-shipped plugins better than prebuilt ones: an
//! engine dev changes `crates/renzora`, the stamp stops matching, and every
//! installed plugin quietly rebuilds itself. Nothing has to be republished and
//! no plugin silently rots.
//!
//! # Why nothing is ever unloaded
//!
//! Every system a plugin registered is a function pointer into its image, and a
//! Bevy schedule holds those for the life of the `App`. Unmapping the image
//! turns them into dangling pointers. `renzora_plugin`'s loader learned this the
//! hard way twice — once as a `FreeLibrary` deadlock, once as a 0xC0000005 at
//! process teardown when a plain `Vec<Library>` was dropped with the World — so
//! the handles here are `ManuallyDrop` for the same reason: "never dropped" has
//! to include the last moment of the process, which is exactly the moment a
//! plain field does not give you.
