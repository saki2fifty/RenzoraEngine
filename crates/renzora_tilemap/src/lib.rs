//! Renzora Tilemap — 2D tilemap data types.
//!
//! A [`TilemapLayer`] is the authored, scene-saved palette config: which
//! tileset atlas the layer paints with, how big a tile is, and how the atlas
//! is sliced. The painted tiles themselves are **ordinary sprite entities** —
//! children of the layer entity carrying [`TilemapTile`] (their grid cell)
//! plus the engine's persisted sprite components (`SpriteImagePath`,
//! `SpriteSheet`, `SpriteCustomSize`), so tiles render, save, load, pick and
//! animate exactly like hand-placed sprites in both the editor and the
//! shipped game. (An earlier iteration rendered tiles as chunked meshes; that
//! made tiles invisible to the hierarchy and the 2D picker, so it was
//! replaced with real entities.)
//!
//! The atlas handle is *not* stored in the saved component — handle ids are
//! runtime-only and don't survive save/load. Instead `TilemapLayer.tileset_path`
//! holds the asset-relative image path (mirroring `SpriteImagePath`), and
//! [`sync_tilesets`] rehydrates the `Handle<Image>` on load or whenever the
//! path changes.
