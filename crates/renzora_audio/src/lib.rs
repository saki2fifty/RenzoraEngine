//! The engine's audio **API**. There is no audio in it.
//!
//! This crate owns the bus graph, the components scenes serialize, the command
//! queue, the timeline and the emitter bookkeeping. What makes sound is a
//! separate C-ABI plugin implementing [`renzora_plugin::audio::Backend`] — drop
//! `audio.dll` beside the binary and the game plays; leave it out and the same
//! binary runs silent, carrying none of the cost.
//!
//! That split is why nothing here links a device, a decoder or any DSP.
//! [`link`] is the one module that knows a backend is a plugin at all, and it
//! answers harmlessly when none is loaded — which is what makes the plugin
//! genuinely removable rather than nominally optional.
//!
//! On wasm the same API is linked against a WebAudio backend instead, because
//! cpal cannot capture in a browser. Neither backend knows the other exists.

// `fx_bridge` and `link` compile on every platform — they are data types and a
// function pointer, with no audio in them. Other UI crates depend on these
// regardless of platform, so they stay outside the cfg gate.
