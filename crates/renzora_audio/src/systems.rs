/// Without one, sound is heard from the game camera (`renzora_audio::runtime`
/// picks the same camera play mode renders through). Most games never need this
/// component: in first person, and in anything 2D, the camera *is* the ears.
///
/// Add one when the two come apart:
/// - **Third person** — the camera trails the character by several metres, so
///   camera ears put the player's own footsteps in front of them and misjudge
///   the distance to everything nearby.
/// - **Strategy / orthographic** — a camera pulled fifty metres back would
///   attenuate the whole scene past `spatial_max_distance` into silence.
/// - **Split screen** — with several viewport cameras, which one hears is a
///   decision, and this is where it is written down.
///
/// Only affects *spatial* voices: a sound with `AudioPlayer.spatial` off (and
/// that is the default) is played at its authored volume and pan and never
/// consults the listener at all.
