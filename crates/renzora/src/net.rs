//! What the rest of the engine calls: a request builder, a blocking [`fetch`],
//! and a streaming one.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in the contract crate
//!
//! Not for the reason most things here do. The engine deliberately contains no
//! HTTP client — `ureq`, `rustls`, `ring`, `webpki` and the platform certificate
//! verifiers are twenty packages that a 2D mobile game making no requests should
//! never compile — so the socket is opened behind the C-ABI plugin boundary by
//! `plugins/http`, and that stays true. Only the *vocabulary* is here.
//!
//! What forces it into this crate specifically is [`shared`]: a `OnceLock`
//! holding the submission queue, the waiter table and the "is a backend loaded"
//! flag. It is **process-global state**, in exactly the sense that the
//! translation table and the theme palette are, and it fails the same way — a
//! caller that linked a private copy would get its own empty queue with no
//! backend attached, so `is_available()` would answer false and every request
//! would fail, with nothing logged. The engine's own crates are linked once and
//! never noticed; a native plugin linking its own copy would.
//!
//! So the split is: **this module owns the queue, `renzora_net` owns the driver
//! that connects it to a backend.** The driver-facing operations below
//! ([`Shared::take_queued`], [`Shared::deliver`], [`Shared::fail_all`] …) are
//! public for that one consumer, not for callers.
//!
//! ## Why blocking, when the boundary underneath is not
//!
//! Every network call in this engine already runs on a thread somebody spawned
//! for it — the marketplace search, the thumbnail fetcher, the sign-in flow, the
//! update check. They were written against a blocking client and their shape is
//! right: a background thread that does one request and posts the result into a
//! Bevy resource is simpler than any callback arrangement, and it is what the
//! surrounding code already expects.
//!
//! So this keeps that shape. [`fetch`] blocks *its own thread* while the frame
//! carries on: it queues the request, parks on a channel, and the per-frame pump
//! (`renzora_net`'s frame pump) hands the answer back. What changed underneath is only who
//! opens the socket.
//!
//! **It must therefore not be called from a system.** A system runs inside the
//! frame the pump needs in order to make progress, so blocking there waits for
//! something that cannot happen until you return. [`Error::NoPump`] is what you
//! get instead of a hang — see [`WATCHDOG`].
