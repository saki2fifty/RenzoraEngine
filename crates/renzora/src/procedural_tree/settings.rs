// Fork note: upstream gated an extra `InspectorOptions` derive behind the
// `inspector` feature (bevy-inspector-egui). renzora has no egui, so the
// feature + that variant are dropped and we keep a single definition. serde
// derives are added so `Tree` (which embeds this) survives renzora's
// reflect-based scene (de)serialization via the `ReflectSerialize` path.
// Bevy 0.19: `Resource: Component`, so `#[derive(Resource)]` now also provides
// the `Component` impl — deriving `Component` too is a conflicting-impl error.
// We keep `Resource` (it gives us `Component` for free, so this stays usable as
// both a resource and a per-entity component) and still reflect both.
