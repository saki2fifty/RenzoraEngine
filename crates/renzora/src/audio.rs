//! The engine side of the audio boundary.
//!
//! [`AudioLink`] is the one place that knows a backend is a `dlopen`'d plugin.
//! Everything else in this crate — the mixer state, the emitters, the timeline —
//! talks to it in ordinary Rust and never sees a function pointer.
//!
//! ## What stays on this side
//!
//! **File I/O**, deliberately, exactly as [`renzora_scripting`] keeps it for
//! scripts. The backend is handed decoded-ready *bytes* and an extension hint;
//! it never opens a path. Exported and Android builds read assets out of an rpak
//! archive, and a backend doing its own `std::fs` would work in the editor and
//! fail in every shipped game.
//!
//! **Handle allocation**, so the engine can name a clip in a `Play` before the
//! backend has finished decoding it, and name a voice before the audio thread
//! has seen the request.
//!
//! ## No backend is a normal state
//!
//! Every method answers sensibly with nothing loaded: calls are dropped, reads
//! come back empty. That is what makes the audio plugin *removable* — delete the
//! file and the same binary runs silent, with the mixer panel still showing a
//! board and every `play_sound` still resolving. The alternative, unwrapping a
//! backend that may not exist, would make audio mandatory in a build system
//! whose entire point is that it is not.
