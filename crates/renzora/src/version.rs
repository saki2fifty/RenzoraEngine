//! The engine's identity — one version string, one release-tag resolver.
//!
//! This used to be four independent literals: `renzora_shell::about` said
//! `r1-alpha7`, `renzora_splash` still said `r1-alpha6`, the command palette
//! hardcoded `r1-alpha6` as its docs fallback, and `build.rs` exported the crate's
//! semver (`0.2.0`) as `RENZORA_ENGINE_VERSION`. Nothing agreed, and nothing could
//! answer the one question the export downloader actually needs — *which release
//! tag matches the binary I am running?* — so it asked for `releases/latest` and
//! got whatever was newest, regardless of ABI.
//!
//! Everything user-facing reads [`ENGINE_VERSION`] from here. The semver in
//! `Cargo.toml` is left alone: it is the crate's version for cargo's benefit, not
//! the engine's version for a human's.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! A binary is one of three things, distinguished by two env vars CI stamps in at
//! compile time:
//!
//! * **Dev** — neither var set. Built from a checkout; has no release of its own.
//! * **Nightly** — `RENZORA_RELEASE_TAG=r1-alpha7-nightly-16aug26`. One release per
//!   night, tagged `<version>-nightly-<ddmonyy>`, published as a prerelease.
//! * **Release** — `RENZORA_RELEASE_TAG=r1-alpha7`, i.e. the tag *is* the version.
//!
//! `option_env!` bakes these in when the `renzora` crate compiles, so they are
//! only picked up by a cold build. CI builds cold every run; a warm local tree
//! will not notice the vars changing, which is fine because a local tree is always
//! Dev anyway.
