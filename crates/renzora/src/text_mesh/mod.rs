//! Shared SDF glyph-mesh machinery.
//!
//! Convert Bevy's *coverage* font atlas into a signed distance field, pack a
//! per-text strip, and render it crisp with [`SdfTextMaterial`]. Two callers
//! build glyph geometry: the world-space UI mesh emitter in `renzora_ember`, and
//! the `text3d` **native plugin**.
//!
//! # Why this is in the contract crate
//!
//! It was its own `renzora_text_mesh` rlib for as long as both callers were
//! linked into the same binary. A native plugin is not: it is compiled by a bare
//! `rustc` and handed exactly three engine crates — `bevy`, `renzora` and
//! `renzora_ember`. A workspace rlib is unreachable from there, and letting the
//! plugin resolve its own copy would be worse than unreachable, because
//! [`SdfTextMaterial`] would then be **two different types**: two `TypeId`s, two
//! `MaterialPlugin` registrations, and ember's text and the plugin's text drawn
//! by two unrelated pipelines.
//!
//! So it moved to where the one-definition rule already applies. [`ensure_sdf_material`]
//! keeps its idempotence guard, and now it is genuinely one material for every
//! caller — which is what the guard always assumed.
//!
//! Layout stays with each caller ([`build_text_mesh`] drives its own for a
//! standalone entity; the UI emitter already has bevy_ui's) — only the
//! coverage→SDF→strip step ([`pack_sdf_strip`]) and the material are shared.
