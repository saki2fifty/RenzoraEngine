//! What plugins this process found on disk, and what became of each.
//!
//! Both loaders report here as they run — `renzora_plugin`'s C-ABI loader and
//! `renzora_native_plugin`'s directory loader — so the Settings UI can list
//! every installed plugin without re-deriving either loader's rules.
//!
//! That last part is the reason this exists rather than the settings panel
//! doing its own `read_dir`. "Is this a plugin?" is a real question with a
//! non-obvious answer on both sides: a C-ABI plugin is a library file that
//! exports one specific symbol and is not a proc-macro dylib, a native plugin is
//! a directory containing `src/lib.rs`, and both loaders skip entries for
//! reasons — wrong scope, statically linked already, ABI too old — that a
//! second implementation would silently disagree about. A panel that lists a
//! *different* set from the one the engine loaded is worse than no panel, and
//! the same mistake has been made here before with script extensions.
//!
//! # Enabling and disabling
//!
//! [`load_disabled_plugins`](crate::load_disabled_plugins) is the persisted
//! list, keyed by [`PluginEntry::id`], and both loaders consult it before
//! loading anything. Disabling **cannot** take effect until the next launch, and
//! that is structural rather than unfinished: a plugin adds systems, resources
//! and function pointers to the `App` while it is being assembled, and Bevy has
//! no way to withdraw those. Unmapping the image is worse still — a retired
//! system is still *in* the schedule, merely returning early.
//!
//! So the toggle records intent, and the loader acts on it at startup. The UI
//! says so plainly instead of pretending otherwise.
