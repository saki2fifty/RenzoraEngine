//! Autoload scenes — scenes listed in `project.toml` that are loaded
//! before `main_scene` and persist across every subsequent
//! `load_scene()` call.
//!
//! Used for engine-wide UI overlays (loading bar), audio managers,
//! save-state holders, settings — anything that must outlive the active
//! scene. Equivalent to Godot's autoloads or Unity's
//! `DontDestroyOnLoad`-on-spawn.
//!
//! # Mechanism
//!
//! Each entry in `project.config.autoload` is loaded via
//! [`scene_io::load_scene`]. The diff between the entity set before and
//! after the load is the set of entities the autoload spawned; every one
//! of them gets a [`Persistent`] component inserted. From then on,
//! `process_pending_scene_loads`'s `Without<Persistent>` filter skips
//! them automatically.
//!
//! # Editor play sessions
//!
//! A game build calls [`load_autoloads`] once on `Startup`. The editor has no
//! equivalent moment — it boots into an editing session, not a game — so
//! pressing Play fires `renzora::LoadAutoloadScenes` and Stop fires
//! `UnloadAutoloadScenes`, handled by the observers at the bottom of this
//! module. That is what makes a global HUD / music / networking scene testable
//! without an export.
//!
//! Teardown despawns the entities [`AutoloadedEntities`] recorded, **not**
//! every `Persistent` entity in the world: the marker is reflected and a user
//! can apply it by hand from the inspector, so a blanket sweep would delete
//! authored scene content.
