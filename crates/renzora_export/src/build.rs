//! Lean static build backend — compiles the game's `renzora` binary from source
//! into a single stripped executable (static Bevy + static std, no sibling
//! dylibs), instead of copying the dynamically-linked dev runtime.
//!
//! A project is a separate asset folder, NOT a Rust workspace — so this compiles
//! the **engine source checkout** the editor was built from (located by walking
//! up from the editor's `dist/<platform>/` dir, see [`find_engine_source`]) and
//! the project's assets ride along in the rpak the caller appends. It builds via
//! `--no-default-features --features runtime` so the `dynamic_linking` feature is
//! dropped (see root `Cargo.toml`), under `[profile.dist-lean]`.
//!
//! The one subtlety is `prefer-dynamic`: `.cargo/config.toml` pins it per target
//! to make the *dev* build share one `bevy_dylib`. Cargo takes RUSTFLAGS from a
//! single highest-priority source with no merging, so setting
//! `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` on the child process makes cargo **ignore** the
//! config rustflags for this one invocation — dropping `prefer-dynamic` without
//! editing any file. The separate `linker` config key is *not* rustflags and
//! survives (so Windows keeps `rust-lld`); on Linux we override it to the
//! near-universal `cc` because a freshly provisioned toolchain may lack the
//! repo's pinned `clang`/`mold`.
