//! Optional UPX compression of the exported game's binaries.
//!
//! UPX packs an executable and prepends a decompressor stub, so the shipped file
//! is roughly half the size and unpacks itself into memory at launch. It is the
//! one size lever that is entirely post-build: it does not change a single line
//! of what was compiled, so it composes with every capability strip, with
//! `panic = "abort"`, and with the profile knobs — and it is the only one that
//! helps the two *copy* packaging modes at all, since those ship an
//! already-built runtime that no cargo flag can reach any more.
//!
//! ## Why the compressed copy is made BEFORE the rpak is appended
//!
//! A single-binary export is `[executable][rpak][16-byte footer]`, and the
//! runtime finds its assets by reading the last 16 bytes of its own file and
//! seeking back (see `renzora_rpak::format::detect_appended_footer`). Handing
//! that file to UPX would mean trusting its overlay handling to preserve trailing
//! bytes it knows nothing about — recoverable if it drops them (the game just
//! finds no assets), but silent. So the order is inverted instead: pack the bare
//! executable, then append the rpak to the *packed* file. The footer still lands
//! at EOF, the runtime still reads it from disk, and UPX never sees our payload.
//!
//! That ordering is also why compression happens on a temporary copy rather than
//! in place: the lean build's output lives in cargo's `target/dist-lean/`, and
//! packing it there would leave a compressed binary where cargo believes it left
//! a fresh one. The next export would find an up-to-date fingerprint, skip the
//! rebuild, and hand UPX its own output — which fails with `AlreadyPackedException`
//! at best, and at worst double-packs.
//!
//! ## `--best --lzma`, not `--brute`
//!
//! Not a compromise for interactivity — measured, they are the same. On the
//! 187 MB `dist` runtime the two produce a **byte-for-byte identical** file
//! (33,363,456 bytes); `--brute` took 1529 s and `--best --lzma` ~100 s.
//! `--lzma` already selects UPX's strongest compressor, and the extra
//! filter/algorithm combinations `--brute` explores have nothing better to offer
//! on an amd64 PE. (Compared on PE only; ELF and Mach-O were not measured.)
//!
//! Measured on `dist/windows-x64/renzora.exe` (the stripped `dist` runtime):
//! **187.3 MB → 31.7 MB in 82 s, an 83% saving.** The packed binary was run
//! headless with `--server` and booted through the full plugin and scripting
//! startup, so packing an engine binary of this size is not merely legal in
//! theory — nothing about Bevy's startup, the dlopen'd plugins or the self-read
//! of the appended rpak minds a decompressor stub. A lean export compresses less
//! (it is already LTO'd and stripped of most of what compresses well) but in the
//! same league.

/// * **Android / Fire TV** — the shipped artefact is an APK (a zip), already
///   deflated, and the executable code inside is a `.so` loaded by the platform
///   loader.
/// * **iOS** — a static library, not an executable.
