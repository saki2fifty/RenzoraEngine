//! Is Docker usable on this machine, and which toolchain image does a platform
//! need?
//!
//! A lean export recompiles the engine from source, and cargo can only target
//! the host triple. Every other platform therefore has to be built inside the
//! `ghcr.io/renzora/<platform>` toolchain container — which is the same thing
//! `renzora build <platform>` does, and the reason those images exist.
//!
//! The engine talks to `docker` directly rather than shelling out to the
//! `renzora` CLI. The CLI is `cargo install`ed and a game developer running a
//! downloaded editor will not have it, whereas Docker is the thing they must
//! install anyway. The image tag is a content hash of the Dockerfiles in the
//! checkout, computed the same way in three places now (CI, the CLI, here) —
//! duplicated deliberately, because the alternative is a dependency on a tool
//! that may not be present.
