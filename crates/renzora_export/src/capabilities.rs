//! Engine capabilities the lean export can strip to shrink the binary.
//!
//! Each capability maps to Bevy features (removed from the export copy's root
//! `Cargo.toml`) and/or `renzora_runtime` subsystem features (removed from the
//! copy's `renzora_runtime/Cargo.toml` `default`). The dev source is never
//! touched — only the disposable copy — so this is safe.
//!
//! Two kinds:
//! * **Safe-leaf** (Solari, gizmos, remote assets, optional codecs): Bevy
//!   features no core crate hard-depends on. Default OFF (auto-stripped), since
//!   they're confidently unneeded.
//! * **Structural subsystems** (audio, navmesh, networking, post-FX, sky, …):
//!   `renzora_runtime` features, made optional in Wave 2. Default ON (kept) — a
//!   game might use them via scripts the scan can't see, so the dev unchecks the
//!   ones they know are unused rather than risk auto-stripping something needed.
