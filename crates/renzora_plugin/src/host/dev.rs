//! Recompiles a plugin when its **source** changes, so editing a Rust file is a
//! live edit rather than a build step.
//!
//! [`super::loader`] already notices a changed `.dll` and swaps it in. This closes
//! the other half: watch `plugins/*/src`, run `cargo build`, drop the artifact
//! where the loader is looking, and let the existing path take it from there.
//! Four links, and only the first two are new:
//!
//! ```text
//! edit a .rs  →  cargo build  →  copy the dll  →  loader reloads it
//! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//!                    here                          already existed
//! ```
//!
//! This is what makes a standalone plugin usable the way a script is. It works at
//! all because such a plugin links no Bevy: a one-file change rebuilds in about a
//! second, where a Bevy-linking plugin would spend half a minute linking and the
//! loop would not be worth having.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in the host rather than an editor crate
//!
//! It is the same feature as the reload. The source watcher, the dll watcher and
//! the reload queue all answer "how does a plugin get into the running process",
//! and splitting them would have an editor crate reaching back into
//! [`super::loader::request_reload`] while both polled overlapping state.
//!
//! It costs this crate nothing to hold: spawning cargo is `std::process`, and the
//! reporting is a resource an editor crate reads. That direction is deliberate and
//! documented in `Cargo.toml` — a plugin author must be able to `cargo add
//! renzora_plugin`, so this crate never depends on the engine.
