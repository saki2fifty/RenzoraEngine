//! Host side of the `renzora_plugin` C ABI.
//!
//! Counterpart to `renzora_plugin::sys`. Builds the function table, hands it to
//! a plugin's `renzora_plugin_init`, and turns whatever the plugin registers
//! into real Bevy components and systems.
//!
//! ## Why this is a separate path from `dynamic_plugin_loader`
//!
//! That crate loads `dylib` plugins which share `bevy_dylib` with the host and
//! get `&mut App` directly. It requires the plugin to have been compiled in the
//! same environment as the engine — same rustc, same Bevy feature set, same
//! `bevy_dylib-<hash>` — which is why third-party prebuilts are so painful.
//!
//! This path has no such requirement: the plugin links nothing, exports one
//! symbol, and receives every capability through a `#[repr(C)]` function table.
//! The two mechanisms coexist; in-tree engine plugins keep using the old one.
//!
//! ## The interesting part: dynamic systems that still run in parallel
//!
//! A plugin declares its query up front (`sys::QueryDesc`). We turn that into a
//! real Bevy query with `QueryParamBuilder`, so the resulting system carries
//! proper component access and the multi-threaded executor can schedule it
//! against everything else. The alternative — giving plugins open-ended `&mut
//! World` access — would force every plugin system to be exclusive and
//! serialise the whole schedule.
