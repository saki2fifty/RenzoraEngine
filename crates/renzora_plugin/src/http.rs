//! HTTP for standalone plugins.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use renzora_plugin::prelude::*;
//! use renzora_plugin::http::{Http, HttpCommands};
//!
//! const FETCH: u64 = 1;
//!
//! fn kick_off(mut cmds: Commands) {
//!     cmds.http_get(FETCH, "https://example.com/status.json");
//! }
//!
//! fn collect(http: Http) {
//!     if let Some(r) = http.poll(FETCH) {
//!         info(&format!("{} → {} bytes", r.status, r.body.len()));
//!     }

//! ```
//!
//! A domain module like [`anim`](crate::anim) and [`physics`](crate::physics),
//! riding the generic service channel — [`sys`](crate::sys) knows nothing about
//! HTTP and this does not move the ABI version.
//!
//! ## Why a tag instead of a callback
//!
//! The boundary has no way to call back into a plugin outside a system, and no
//! futures — a function pointer handed over would have to stay valid across a
//! hot reload, which is exactly what generation-gating exists to prevent. So a
//! request carries a `u64` the plugin chose, and the plugin polls for it. That
//! is also what makes reloading safe: a response whose requester was swapped out
//! is simply never collected, rather than dispatched into a dead build.
//!
//! Requests are **not** entity-scoped. Fetching a URL belongs to the plugin, not
//! to anything in the world, so these go through
//! [`Commands::call_service`](crate::ecs::Commands::call_service).
