//! Native file and folder pickers.
//!
//! Opt in with `features = ["dialog"]`. A domain module like
//! [`anim`](crate::anim), [`physics`](crate::physics) and [`http`](crate::http):
//! it rides [`CommandKind::Service`](crate::sys::CommandKind::Service) going out
//! and [`ReplySource`](crate::sys::ReplySource) coming back, so it adds **no**
//! boundary surface and does not move [`sys::VERSION_MINOR`].
//!
//! That it costs nothing is the point of the generic reply channel. Before it,
//! every domain the host had to answer — meshes, images, HTTP — paid an ABI bump
//! for a source of its own. This is the first that did not.
//!
//! ## Why the host has to do it
//!
//! Nothing stops a plugin linking `rfd` itself. It would then own a second copy
//! of the platform's dialog stack, opened from a thread the editor knows nothing
//! about, parented to no window — which on Windows means a modal that can fall
//! behind the editor with no way back to it. Going through the host gets the
//! right parent window and the editor's own last-used directory.
//!
//! ## Asking, then collecting
//!
//! Fire-and-tag, like [`http`](crate::http), and for the same reason: the
//! boundary has no callbacks, and a function pointer handed over would have to
//! survive a hot reload — exactly what generation-gating prevents. A dialog
//! whose requester was swapped out is simply never collected.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use renzora_plugin::dialog::{DialogCommands, Dialogs, DialogFilter};
//!
//! const PICK_DOCS: u64 = 1;
//!
//! fn browse(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     commands.pick_folder(PICK_DOCS, "Choose a docs folder");
//! }
//!
//! fn collect(dialogs: Dialogs, mut cfg: ResMut<Config>) {
//!     if let Some(outcome) = dialogs.poll(PICK_DOCS) {
//!         match outcome.path() {
//!             Some(path) => cfg.docs = path.into(),
//!             // Cancelling is an ordinary outcome, not an error. It arrives as
//!             // a reply so a plugin can re-enable whatever it disabled.
//!             None => info("cancelled"),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
