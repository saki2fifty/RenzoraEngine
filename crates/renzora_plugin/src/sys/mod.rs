//! The raw C ABI between the Renzora host and a `dlopen`'d plugin.
//!
//! Plugin authors never touch this module — they use the ergonomic layer in the
//! crate root, which is a thin shim over these calls. This is the layer that has
//! to stay stable forever, so it is deliberately small, boring, and hand-written.
//!
//! ## The one rule
//!
//! **A plugin exports exactly one symbol ([`INIT_SYMBOL`]) and imports nothing
//! from the host.** The host passes [`Interface`] *in* at load time. That is the
//! whole reason a plugin can be built on any machine with any rustc: there is no
//! dynamic symbol to resolve against `renzora.exe`, so there is no filename to
//! match, no `bevy_dylib-<hash>` to find, and no `TypeId` to line up. The only
//! thing both sides must agree on is the layout of the `#[repr(C)]` types below.
//!
//! ## Why host components are copied rather than pointed at
//!
//! It is tempting to hand a plugin a raw pointer into Bevy's component storage
//! and let it cast to a mirror struct. For the host's own types that is
//! **undefined behaviour**: `bevy::Transform` is not `#[repr(C)]` (it derives
//! only `Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy`), so its field order is unspecified and
//! a compiler update may reorder it. `glam::Quat` is worse — it has three
//! different representations depending on SIMD backend (`repr(transparent)` over
//! `f32x4` on coresimd, over `float32x4_t` on NEON, `repr(align(16))` on
//! scalar), so its size and alignment vary by target.
//!
//! So host types cross as the frozen mirrors below, copied in and out around the
//! call. **Plugin-owned** components have no such problem — the plugin defines
//! the layout, registers it via [`ComponentDesc`], and gets a direct pointer. In
//! practice most component data is plugin-owned, so most access is copy-free.
//!
//! ## Versioning
//!
//! A plugin accepts any host whose MAJOR matches and whose MINOR is at least the
//! one it was built against. That rule only holds if MINOR changes are strictly
//! **append-only**, so be precise about which is which:
//!
//! * **MINOR** — a new function appended to the end of [`Interface`], or a new
//!   field appended to the end of a struct the plugin only reads. An older
//!   plugin never touches it and keeps working.
//! * **MAJOR** — anything else. Changing a function's signature, reordering or
//!   removing a field, or changing what an existing field *means*.
//!
//! Getting this wrong is not a cosmetic mistake. [`SystemEntry`] once returned
//! `()` and was changed to return [`SystemStatus`] under a MINOR bump; a plugin
//! built before that passed the handshake, and the host then called a `void`
//! function and read a return value nothing had written. The process died with
//! no useful diagnostic. When in doubt, bump MAJOR — the cost is rebuilding
//! plugins, and the alternative is memory corruption.
//!
//! ### Adding a value to a plugin-written enum
//!
//! [`Schedule`], [`FieldKind`], [`Access`], [`RenderPhase`], [`Primitive`],
//! [`CommandKind`] and [`LogLevel`] are all written by the plugin and read by
//! the host. They are **newtypes over `u32`, not `#[repr(u32)]` enums**, and
//! that is load-bearing rather than stylistic.
//!
//! A plugin built against a newer ABI writes a value this build has no name for.
//! With a real `enum` that is undefined behaviour at the moment the host reads
//! it — and not the harmless kind, because rustc attaches `!range` metadata to
//! the load, so LLVM may assume the impossible and a `match` can take an
//! arbitrary arm. The read happens inside `from_raw_parts` over plugin memory
//! for the ones that live in structs, and straight off the boundary for the ones
//! passed by value, so there is no point at which the host could check first.
//!
//! The version handshake is *supposed* to refuse such a plugin, and it does.
//! But building on that means the soundness of every appended value rests on the
//! handshake staying bug-free forever, and the handshake has been wrong before —
//! see the [`SystemEntry`] story above. A newtype removes the question: every
//! `u32` is a valid value, unknown ones fall to a `_` arm, and "appending a
//! value is MINOR" is *true* rather than usually true.
//!
//! So: append a constant, bump MINOR in the same commit, and make sure every
//! `match` on it does something defensible with an unrecognised value. The host
//! generally warns and degrades — an unknown [`Schedule`] runs in `Update`, an
//! unknown [`Primitive`] draws a cube — except for [`Access`], where a term the
//! host cannot interpret would shift every later cell index and hand the plugin
//! its own data at the wrong offsets. That one refuses the system outright.
//!
//! # Editing anything in this file
//!
//! Which rule applies depends on **how the type crosses**, not on how small the
//! edit looks. Get it backwards and nothing tells you: both sides compile their
//! own copy of this file from independent source trees, so there is no link
//! error, no symbol to mismatch, and no version number that moves on its own.
//!
//! ## A table read by offset MAY be appended to
//!
//! [`Interface`], [`SystemCall`], [`FrameCtx`], [`CommandSink`], [`MeshSource`],
//! [`ImageSource`], [`HttpSource`] and [`PanelAction`] are handed over as a
//! pointer and read field by field. A build compiled against an older layout
//! reads the prefix it knows and never touches what follows, so a field added
//! **at the very end** is invisible to it.
//!
//! Append it, append its `"name: type"` to the golden list in
//! `tests/abi_order.rs`, and bump [`VERSION_MINOR`] in the same commit.
//!
//! Anything else — inserting, reordering, removing, retyping, or changing a
//! function pointer's signature in place — moves a slot an already-built plugin
//! is compiled to call, and needs [`VERSION_MAJOR`]. The signature change is the
//! one that hides: a fn pointer is one `usize` whatever its arity, so neither a
//! field-name list nor `size_of` moves when its shape does.
//!
//! ## Every other type here is FROZEN — not even appendable
//!
//! A struct crossing through a pointer ([`MeshDataDesc`], [`ComponentDesc`],
//! [`FieldDesc`], [`Command`], [`QueryView`], [`InputState`], every `*Desc`), by
//! value inside another ([`StrRef`], [`Vec3`], [`Quat`], [`Transform`]), or as
//! opaque payload bytes ([`SpawnMeshDesc`], [`ServiceCall`], the domain commands)
//! is **not read prefix-first**. The reader dereferences every field, walks an
//! array at its own `size_of`, or memcpys the whole thing. There is no prefix to
//! preserve, so appending is exactly as fatal as reordering.
//!
//! Four guards exist and all four are blind to this. `VERSION_MINOR` does not
//! move, because you did not touch a table. The load-time [`Interface`] prefix
//! hash covers the *spelling* of `*const MeshDataDesc`, not its contents. The
//! golden test cannot see inside a pointer. And the payload length checks are
//! `<` minimums, which a reorder passes and a growth passes.
//!
//! ## Instead: mint a new type beside the old one
//!
//! Add `MeshDataDesc2` next to [`MeshDataDesc`], add `add_mesh_data2` at the
//! **end** of [`Interface`], and leave the old struct and old slot untouched
//! forever. Freezing costs one dead struct; editing costs every prebuilt plugin,
//! silently.
//!
//! This is already the practice here twice, both times arrived at the hard way.
//! [`MeshColors`] is a separate *argument* to [`MeshSource::write`] rather than a
//! field on [`MeshDataDesc`], because that struct is shared with `add_mesh_data`.
//! [`FieldRange`] is a separate struct reached by its own `set_field_range`
//! rather than three fields on [`FieldDesc`], because widening `FieldDesc`
//! changes the stride of an array the host walks and yields garbage from element
//! one onward.
//!
//! ## By-value embedding is the trap that catches careful people
//!
//! [`StrRef`] is a field of seven boundary structs *and* a by-value argument of
//! two [`Interface`] functions. [`Vec3`] is a field of six *and* the element type
//! of four pointer arrays. Growing either is an ABI break authored in a different
//! part of the file from the struct it breaks: every golden list stays identical,
//! `size_of::<Interface>()` stays identical, and both sides compile.
//!
//! **Before editing any type here, grep for it as a field type.** If it appears
//! inside another boundary struct, you are editing that struct too.
//!
//! ## Some contracts are numbering, not shape
//!
//! A [`Key`]'s value **is** its bit index into [`InputState`]. Each domain's
//! `SERVICE` id is baked into every plugin ever shipped. `STR_CAP` and `NAME_CAP`
//! are inline capacities other crates reconstruct by hand. Renumbering or
//! resizing any of them compiles cleanly on both sides and silently remaps
//! behaviour — as frozen as a field order, and no layout test can see them.
