//! Read the host's measurements: frame time, FPS, entity count, per-render-pass
//! GPU and CPU times, process CPU and memory.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use renzora_plugin::prelude::*;
//! use renzora_plugin::diagnostics::Diagnostics;
//!
//! fn report(diags: Diagnostics) {
//!     if let Some(fps) = diags.get("fps") {
//!         info!("{:.0} fps", fps.smoothed);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this is a system param and not an `Interface` function
//!
//! Reading the store needs the world, and [`SystemCall::host`](crate::sys::SystemCall::host)
//! is null while a system runs — the same constraint that made
//! [`Meshes`](crate::ecs::Meshes) and [`Http`](crate::http::Http) params. So the
//! host builds a [`DiagnosticSource`](crate::sys::DiagnosticSource) for the call
//! and this borrows it.
//!
//! ## Why it is not behind a feature
//!
//! The domain modules (`anim`, `physics`, `http`) are opt-in because each is a
//! *vocabulary* riding the generic service channel — bytes `sys` never reads —
//! so adding one moves this crate's semver rather than the ABI. Diagnostics are
//! not that shape: the source pointer is a field of `SystemCall` in every build,
//! the ABI version already records it, and gating the reader would only mean a
//! plugin has to name a feature to use a field that is there regardless.
//!
//! ## What the host does not promise
//!
//! **Which measurements exist.** The set depends on what the host assembled: an
//! editor carries all of them, a shipped game typically carries none, and a
//! backend without GPU timestamp queries has the `render/*/elapsed_cpu` paths but
//! not `elapsed_gpu`. Every reader must handle absence — [`get`](Diagnostics::get)
//! returns `Option` for that reason, and treating a missing diagnostic as zero is
//! how a profiler ends up drawing a flat line and calling it data.
//!
//! **That a present measurement has a value.** A diagnostic registers before its
//! first sample, so `value` is `NaN` for the first frames. [`Diagnostic::is_valid`]
//! is the check; plotting `NaN` is what makes a graph vanish.
