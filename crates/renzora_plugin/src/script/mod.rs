//! Implement a scripting language as a plugin.
//!
//! The engine's scripting *system* is statically linked and stays that way: the
//! hooks, the command vocabulary, the context, the queue that applies commands
//! to the world. What is **not** in the engine is any particular interpreter.
//! This module is the contract between the two, so Lua, Wren, Python or
//! anything else is an ordinary `plugins/<lang>/` cdylib built with no engine
//! checkout.
//!
//! That is the whole point of the split. Before it, "which language can I
//! script in" was decided by which interpreter the engine was compiled with.
//! After it, the engine ships a scripting API and a language is a plugin.
//!
//! ## The shape of a call
//!
//! The host owns everything with a Bevy type in it. It walks the scripted
//! entities, builds the context, resolves and reads the script file, and
//! applies whatever comes back. The plugin owns exactly one thing: turning
//! source text plus a context into a list of [`ScriptCommand`]s.
//!
//! ```text
//!   host                                   plugin
//!   ────                                   ──────
//!   encode FrameContext  ── once/frame ──▶  (cached by frame_seq)
//!   encode EntityContext ── per entity ──▶
//!   read + hand over source ────────────▶   compile / reuse VM
//!                                           run the hook
//!                        ◀── ScriptReply ─  commands, vars, draws
//!   apply commands to the World
//! ```
//!
//! ### The host keeps file I/O, deliberately
//!
//! A plugin never opens a script file. It is handed `source` and a `version`
//! that changes when the source does. That is not a restriction for its own
//! sake — exported and Android builds read scripts out of an rpak archive
//! through a closure the engine owns, and a plugin doing its own `std::fs`
//! would silently work in the editor and fail in every shipped game. Hot reload
//! also stays where the file watcher already is.
//!
//! ### Synchronous reads go back through [`ScriptHostCalls`]
//!
//! Most of the API is one-way: a script asks for something to happen and the
//! command queue does it after the hook returns. Reads cannot work that way —
//! `get("Health.current")` has to answer *now* — so the call carries a small
//! table of host functions valid for exactly the duration of that call.
//!
//! ## Ops, not one function pointer per hook
//!
//! A backend registers a single `extern "C"` entry point and the hook is
//! selected by [`ScriptOp`]. The alternative, a struct of eight named function
//! pointers, would make adding a ninth hook an ABI change — every prebuilt
//! language plugin would need rebuilding to add `on_late_update`. With an op
//! code, a plugin that does not know an op returns [`ScriptStatus::UnknownOp`]
//! and the host treats it exactly like a script that does not define the hook.
