//! Renzora Clouds — volumetric clouds raymarched through a spherical deck.
//!
//! The model is the Horizon Zero Dawn one (Schneider/Vos) with Frostbite's
//! scattering integration (Hillaire): a tileable Perlin-Worley base map defines
//! the silhouette, a 3D Worley volume erodes it, a height profile turns a map
//! with no vertical detail into flat-bottomed billowing cumulus, and a second
//! march toward the sun gives every sample its own shadow.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! * [`noise`] bakes the two noise fields once, on the GPU.
//! * [`sky`] reads the scene's atmosphere so the deck relights with it.
//! * [`material`] carries them plus one uniform block to the shader.
//! * `sync_clouds` here keeps a camera-centred dome alive and packs the uniform.
//!
//! The dome is *only* a way to get one fragment per sky pixel; `clouds.wgsl`
//! marches from the camera against real shell geometry and never touches the
//! dome surface. That is what lets the deck curve down to the horizon by itself
//! and what lets a camera climb up through it.
