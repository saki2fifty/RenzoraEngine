//! Couples the cloud lighting to the scene's atmosphere.
//!
//! Bevy's atmosphere lives entirely in the render world: its transmittance,
//! sky-view and aerial-perspective LUTs are bound in the atmosphere node's own
//! group 0, and a `Material` — which builds its bind group from main-world data
//! — has no way to reach them. So instead of sampling those LUTs, this evaluates
//! the same physics on the CPU, from the same `ScatteringMedium` asset the sky
//! is rendered from, using Bevy's own `Falloff::sample` and
//! `PhaseFunction::sample`. Change the medium (or swap Earth for Mars) and the
//! clouds follow, because there is no second copy of the model here.
//!
//! That trade is affordable because of what actually varies. The two terms that
//! matter most to a cloud — how much sunlight survives down to the deck, and
//! what colour the sky filling its shadows is — depend on the sun's elevation
//! and the deck's altitude, not on the pixel. They are one value for the whole
//! sky, so a per-pixel LUT fetch would return the same answer a few hundred
//! thousand times. Only the haze genuinely varies with view direction, and that
//! is handled by evaluating the horizon *twice*, toward the sun and away from
//! it, and letting the shader blend between them by azimuth.
//!
//! Everything is returned **relative to the same quantity with the sun at
//! zenith**, so a noon sky multiplies the authored colours by exactly 1 and only
//! the deviation from noon — the reddening, the dimming, the shift of the
//! horizon — reaches the clouds. That keeps every inspector colour meaning what
//! it says it means.
