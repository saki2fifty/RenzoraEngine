// a virtual planet, after "The Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon Zero
// Dawn" (Schneider/Vos) and "Physically Based Sky, Atmosphere and Cloud
// Rendering in Frostbite" (Hillaire).
//
// This replaces an earlier 2.5D dome that painted FBM straight onto a sphere.
// The difference that matters is that density here is a *field with thickness*:
// a second march toward the sun gives every sample its own shadow, so clouds
// have bright sunward faces and dark undersides instead of a fake vertical
// gradient, and the deck curves down to the horizon on its own because the
// march is against real shell geometry rather than a painted gradient.
//
// The mesh is still a dome centred on the camera, but only as a way to get one
// fragment per sky pixel — nothing about the shading uses its surface. The
// march starts at the camera, so flying up through the deck works: the entry
// interval is solved for all three cases (below, inside, above).
//
// Everything here is in KILOMETRES with y = altitude above the surface. At a
// 6371 km planet radius, `length(planet_space_position) - radius` in metres
// loses the whole 1.15 km deck to f32 rounding; kilometres plus the analytic
// height expansion in `height_at` keeps every intermediate small.
