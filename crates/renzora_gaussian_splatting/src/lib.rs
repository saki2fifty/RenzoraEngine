//! 3D Gaussian-splatting distribution plugin.
//!
//! Wraps the vendored [`bevy_gaussian_splatting`] renderer in a statically
//! linked engine plugin. Scenes author splats through the serializable
//! [`renzora::GaussianSplat`] contract component (a project-relative `.ply` /
//! `.gcloud` path plus per-cloud tuning); this plugin resolves it into the
//! live cloud handle + [`CloudSettings`] the renderer consumes — the same
//! path-in-component / handle-at-runtime split models, audio, and particles
//! use, so the raw asset `Handle` never has to survive the scene serializer.
//!
//! Runtime scope on purpose: the same plugin renders splats in the editor
//! viewport, in-editor play, and the shipped game. In builds without this
//! engine feature, `GaussianSplat` components remain inert data (the host
//! registers the type, see `renzora_engine`).
//!
//! Editor-only wiring (inspector entry, Add-Entity preset) is compile-gated
//! behind the `editor` feature; in a shipped game those registrations are
//! harmless no-ops because the editor registries they target don't exist.
