//! Editor-side (bevy_ui / ember) panels for `renzora_game_ui`.
//!
//! Currently: a WORK-IN-PROGRESS native port of the egui `UiCanvasPanel`
//! (panel id "ui_canvas") — the WYSIWYG UI canvas editor — built in split files.
//!
//! Why a separate crate: the native panels need `renzora_ember`, but
//! `ember -> renzora_hui -> renzora_game_ui`, so `game_ui` can't depend on ember
//! (cycle). This crate sits above ember and depends on both, reading game_ui's
//! editor types (`UiCanvas`, `canvas_render::UiCanvasRender`).
//!
//! Architecture: the game UI is *real bevy_ui* rendered to an offscreen image by
//! `crate::game_ui::canvas_render` (`UiCanvasRender.image_handle`). The native
//! panel displays that rendered image (an `ImageNode`) and overlays the editing
//! chrome — selection box, resize/rotate handles, marquee — as bevy_ui nodes, so
//! it never has to reimplement the egui `paint_*` widget-preview functions.
//!
//! Files:
//! - `lib.rs`     — plugin, shared `NativeCanvasState`, active-canvas sync, root build
//! - `viewport.rs`— the rendered-canvas image + zoomed design frame
//! - `toolbar.rs` — zoom / grid / snap controls
//!
//! # Its own panel
//!
//! Registered as the `ui_canvas` dock panel. It spent a while mounted *inside*
//! the viewport panel instead, revealed by `ViewportView::Ui` — a stopgap from
//! before `overlay.rs` / `interaction.rs` existed, when the egui panel was still
//! the real editor and this could not yet stand alone.
//!
//! The cost of that arrangement was that opening a UI took the 3D view away:
//! one surface, two jobs, and whichever you were not doing vanished. As a panel
//! it docks anywhere, sits beside the viewport if you want both, and the
//! viewport goes back to being 3D-or-2D and nothing else.
//!
//! It still shows the scene behind the canvas — `viewport.rs` reads the shared
//! `renzora::ViewportRenderTarget` image, which is contract state any panel may
//! sample. Borrowing the picture never required living inside the panel that
//! draws it.
