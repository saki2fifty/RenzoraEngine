//! The project's Rust scripts, compiled into this binary.
//!
//! **This file is generated.** The version checked into the repo returns an
//! empty list; the lean exporter overwrites it (and the manifest beside it)
//! inside `target/export-src/`, the throwaway workspace copy an export compiles.
//! Editing it here changes nothing about an export.
//!
//! ## Why scripts are compiled in rather than loaded
//!
//! In the editor a `.rs` script is built into a dylib and `dlopen`'d, which is
//! sound only because script and engine share one `bevy_dylib` — one `World`
//! type, one set of `TypeId`s. A lean export links Bevy statically and has no
//! shared image, so a script dylib would carry its own copy of Bevy and calling
//! into it would be memory corruption with no diagnostic. `RustScriptPlugin`
//! refuses to register a backend in that build, which is why an exported game
//! reports `No backend for Some("rs")`.
//!
//! Compiling the source into the binary removes the boundary rather than trying
//! to make it safe: there is no library, no symbol lookup and no ABI question,
//! because the script is part of the same compilation as everything it touches.
//!
//! ## What stays identical
//!
//! The dispatcher does not change. `renzora_rust_script` fills `LoadedScripts`
//! from [`scripts()`] instead of from loaded libraries, and everything after
//! that — one `fn(&mut World, Entity)` per entity per frame, keyed by canonical
//! identity, wrapped in a panic guard — is the same code. A script must behave
//! the same in the editor and in an export, or the export cannot be tested by
//! playing it.
//!
//! Every script in `scripts/` is compiled in, not only those some scene
//! references: a scene can be loaded at runtime and a `ScriptComponent` added at
//! runtime, so any "which are actually used" analysis would eventually be wrong
//! in the direction that breaks a game silently. An unused script costs bytes in
//! `.text`, never cycles — the dispatcher only ever looks up identities that a
//! live entity asked for.
