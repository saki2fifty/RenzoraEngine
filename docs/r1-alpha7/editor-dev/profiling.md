# Profiling with Tracy

Renzora ships a **Tracy profiler bridge** (`plugins/tracy`) — a standalone C-ABI
plugin that streams live engine telemetry to a running
[Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiler over its native protocol:

- a **frame mark** per app frame, and
- every Bevy diagnostic as a named Tracy plot — frame time, FPS, entity count,
  per-render-pass GPU/CPU span times, and system CPU/memory where the platform
  supports it.

> **This plugin gives you plots, never a flame graph.** Per-system CPU zones and
> GPU-pass zones are `#[cfg(feature = "trace")]` inside `bevy_ecs` and
> `#[cfg(feature = "tracing-tracy")]` inside `bevy_render` — instrumentation that
> was compiled out does not exist to be switched on, so no plugin loaded at run
> time can produce it. With only this bridge running, Tracy's **Flame Graph and
> zone Statistics windows stay empty** and `tracy-csvexport -e`/`-g` return
> nothing; all the signal is in the plot rows. For the flame graph, use the
> **profiling build** below, which compiles the instrumentation in.

## The profiling build — full flame graph + per-system Statistics

The bridge's *plots* tell you *how much* (a pass cost 2 ms, FPS is 52) but not
*what ran when*. For the per-system timeline across all ~200 plugins, and the
GPU-pass zones, build with the `profiling` feature:

```
cargo renzora profile        # native: build + stage + launch, trace_tracy compiled in
```

This is just `cargo renzora run` with `--features profiling`, which turns on:

- **`bevy/trace`** — the per-system and render-node CPU spans. Bevy gates system
  zones behind this feature, so *without it the 200-plugin breakdown is invisible*
  even with Tracy connected.
- **`bevy/trace_tracy`** — installs Tracy's tracing layer (CPU zones + one frame
  mark per frame) and the GPU-timestamp zones in `bevy_render`.
- **`renzora_runtime/profiling`** — adds `RenderDiagnosticsPlugin`, which is what
  actually allocates the Tracy GPU context so the GPU-pass zones record. (GPU
  zones work on Dx12/Vulkan; macOS/Metal is excluded upstream.)

Start a Tracy **server first**, then `cargo renzora profile` — the on-demand
client only buffers once a profiler connects, so launch order doesn't lose data.

> **Leave the in-app "Tracy Profiler" toggle OFF in a profiling build.** Bevy
> already emits one frame mark per frame; the `plugins/tracy` bridge marking too
> would double-count every frame and halve the reported frame time.

**`cargo renzora` and `cargo renzora profile` both launch with `RENZORA_NO_XR=1`.**
Editing in a headset is `cargo renzora xr`.

This used to apply to the profiling lane only, which produced a memorable
symptom: the *instrumented* build ran faster than the normal one.

If an OpenXR runtime is installed and set as the system default — not connected,
not in use, merely present — the editor otherwise takes the XR-capable boot,
which disables `PipelinedRenderingPlugin`. The render sub-app then runs inline on
the main thread instead of in parallel with the sim. That showed up as
`sub app{name=RenderApp}` nested under `update` and costing ~11.6 ms of a 27 ms
frame: a serialization that swamps whatever you were actually trying to measure,
and which every ordinary editor session was silently paying.

Add `--xr` when the headset path *is* the subject:

```
cargo renzora profile --xr    # profile the XR-capable (non-pipelined) boot
```

A `RENZORA_NO_XR` already set in your environment always wins; the flag is
consumed by the xtask and never forwarded to the binary.

> **It moves the plugin ABI.** Compiling `trace_tracy` recompiles `bevy_dylib`
> (CLAUDE.md §3), so prebuilt community plugins in `plugins/` won't load against a
> profiling binary. Everything built from source in the same invocation — the
> editor bundle and every workspace plugin — still matches, so the editor and its
> built-in features are unaffected. It's a disposable build; don't ship it.

## Reading a capture

- **Frame time graph** (top ruler): each frame is one mark. A tall frame is a
  hitch; click it to zoom the timeline to that frame.
- **Flame graph** (the main timeline): nested CPU zones per frame — the call/scope
  tree of which system ran when, and for how long. A wide bar = an expensive
  system. There's a separate **GPU** track below the CPU threads with the render
  passes (`main_opaque_pass_3d`, shadow passes, `ssao`, `atmosphere_luts`,
  `bloom`, …).
- **Statistics window** (top bar → *Statistics*): every zone aggregated, sortable
  by total or self time. **This is the "which of my systems is the bottleneck"
  view** — sort by total time and the worst offenders rise to the top. Works for
  GPU zones too (switch the source), giving a per-pass GPU cost ranking.
- **Find Zone** (top bar → *Find Zone*): a per-zone histogram + call-site — use it
  once Statistics has named a suspect, to see its distribution and where it's
  invoked.
- **`prepare_windows` eating most of a frame on the CPU side is the tell for
  GPU-bound** — the CPU is blocked waiting on the GPU to present. In that case the
  answer is in the GPU track / GPU Statistics, not the CPU systems.

### Exporting for offline analysis

With the profiling build, zones exist, so the Tracy **CLI** tools can dump them to
CSV (grab the tools from the *same* Tracy release as your GUI):

```
tracy-capture -o out.tracy -s 8 -f          # capture 8s from the running editor
tracy-csvexport -e out.tracy > cpu.csv      # CPU zones: name,…,total_ns,self,counts,mean…
tracy-csvexport -g out.tracy > gpu.csv      # GPU zones: name,…,GPU execution time
```

Aggregate `cpu.csv` by `name` for total self-time per system, and `gpu.csv` for
ms/frame per pass (divide summed GPU time by frame count).

## Enabling it

One switch: **Settings → Plugins → Tracy Profiler → Enable Tracy**. It takes
effect immediately — no restart. The opt-in persists in
`~/.config/renzora/tracy.json` (`%APPDATA%\renzora\tracy.json` on Windows).

> Earlier versions also required Dev Mode and a restart. Both were consequences
> of the bridge living inside the editor binary: it had to decide at startup
> whether to install its diagnostic sources, so the switch could only be read
> once. As a plugin it installs nothing — it reads measurements the host already
> publishes — so enabling is just "start feeding".

**Turning it off** stops the feeding immediately: no plots, no frame marks. It
does **not** close the Tracy listener socket, because `tracy-client` has no
shutdown outside its `manual-lifetime` feature. That costs an idle socket and
nothing more — the client is built with `ondemand`, so it buffers no trace data
until a profiler actually connects. To get the socket back too, restart.

**To remove Tracy entirely**, delete `plugins/tracy.dll` from beside the
executable. There is no profiler code in the engine itself.

### Choosing what to plot

Under the master switch is a **Plots** list — one toggle per group, applied on
the next frame:

| Group | Covers | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Frame | `fps`, `frame_time`, `frame_count` | on |
| Entity count | `entity_count` | on |
| CPU & memory | `system/*`, `process/*` | on |
| Render passes — GPU time | `render/*/elapsed_gpu` | on |
| Render passes — CPU time | `render/*/elapsed_cpu` | on |
| Shader & pipeline counters | `*_invocations`, `*_primitives_out` | **off** |
| Other diagnostics | anything else, incl. `ui/*` reactivity | on |

Grouped rather than one toggle per plot because the render paths are per-pass and
open-ended — a heavier scene has more of them, and a checklist that grows as you
load a level is not a settings panel.

Invocation counts default off because they are the one group that is usually
noise: raw counters in the millions, which Tracy autoscales, crowding the
millisecond timings that a frame-budget question actually turns on. Turn them on
when the question is "how much geometry is this pass actually touching".

*Other diagnostics* is the catch-all and defaults on deliberately. The host's
diagnostic set is open — any engine crate or plugin can register a path — and
silently dropping unrecognised ones would look exactly like the engine having
stopped measuring.

#### Reading the `ui/*` rows

The reactive UI publishes seven diagnostics, and together they answer "why did
the editor get slower when I selected something":

Eleven `ui/*` diagnostics stream, and between them they answer "why did the
editor get slower when I selected something".

**The bevy_ui pipeline** — where the cost usually is:

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ui/content_ms` | `Prepare` → `Content`: propagation + text measurement |
| `ui/layout_ms` | `Content` → `Layout`: taffy solving the tree |
| `ui/nodes_total` | Live `Node` count |
| `ui/text_nodes` | Live `Node` + `Text` count — what measurement scales with |

**The reactive layer** — where it usually *isn't*:

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ui/bindings_total` | Bindings walked this frame (excludes parked) |
| `ui/bindings_parked` | Bindings behind a collapsed section — free |
| `ui/bindings_skipped` | Skipped by the dependency gate without running |
| `ui/bindings_changed` | Produced a new value, i.e. a UI write happened |
| `ui/reactions_us` | Binding recompute time, µs |
| `ui/lists_us` | Keyed-list snapshot + diff time, µs |
| `ui/rows_rebuilt` | List rows built or rebuilt |

**Check the reactive rows first, to rule them out.** Opening inspector sections
looks exactly like a reactivity problem and has twice been diagnosed as one; both
times it was not. The tell is `bindings_changed` sitting near zero while the
frame time climbs — nothing is recomputing, the rows simply exist. Note the units
differ deliberately: the reactive figures are **µs** and the pipeline ones are
**ms**, because that is the ratio between them.

Then read `content_ms` against `layout_ms`, because the two point to opposite
fixes. **Content-bound** means text measurement dominates — fewer or cheaper
labels per row. **Taffy-bound** means the tree does — fewer nodes per row.
`nodes_total` is the number both scale with, and watching it jump on selection
tells you what a row really costs: an inspector that adds ~1,000 nodes for ~120
bindings is paying for the nodes, not the bindings.

#### What "off" does to a row already on screen

Turning a group off stops it feeding on the next frame. **A row already on
Tracy's timeline stays there, showing a frozen line**, and that is a limit of
Tracy rather than a shortcut here: its protocol carries `PlotDataInt`,
`PlotDataFloat`, `PlotDataDouble`, `PlotConfig` and `PlotName`, and nothing that
removes a plot. The data model is append-only — once a name has been emitted in a
capture, the server keeps its row for the rest of that capture.

Two ways to get the clean feed:

- **Set the toggles before connecting.** A group that is off when the profiler
  attaches is never emitted, so no row is ever created. The plugin checks the
  toggle *before* it creates the plot name, which is the only moment the decision
  can still be made.
- **Reconnect.** The on-demand client discards plot data while nothing is
  attached, and replays only GPU contexts, lock names and thread names on
  connect — never plots. So the next connection shows exactly the groups that are
  enabled at that moment.

## Capturing

Enable the toggle, then start a Tracy server (the desktop `Tracy.exe`, or the
headless `tracy-capture` CLI). The editor connects and the timeline fills with
frame marks and plots. Because the plugin is Editor-scoped, it profiles the
editor — including gameplay running in the viewport's play mode.

## How it's wired (for plugin authors)

`plugins/tracy` is a standalone C-ABI plugin — it does not link Bevy, and its
only dependencies are `renzora_plugin` and `tracy-client`. It

- reads the host's measurements through the `Diagnostics` system param
  (`SystemCall::diagnostics`, ABI MINOR 4.8), which hands a system this frame's
  `DiagnosticsStore` as `(path, value, smoothed)` triples,
- registers its *Tracy Profiler* section with `App::add_settings_section`, whose
  `EmberToggle` reports through `PanelActionId`,
- persists its own opt-in, and
- creates nothing at all while off — no client, no socket, no plot names.

This is the reference example for reading diagnostics from a plugin: an FPS
overlay, a perf HUD or a telemetry uploader all want the same param.

```rust
use renzora_plugin::diagnostics::Diagnostics;

fn report(diags: Diagnostics) {
    if let Some(fps) = diags.get("fps") {
        info(&format!("{:.0} fps", fps.smoothed));
    }
}
```

Two things the host does not promise. **Which measurements exist** — an editor
carries all of them, a shipped game usually carries none, and a backend without
GPU timestamp queries has `render/*/elapsed_cpu` but not `elapsed_gpu`; `get`
returns `Option` for that reason. **That a present measurement has a value** — a
diagnostic registers before its first sample, so check `Diagnostic::is_valid()`
rather than plotting a `NaN`.

Nothing about Tracy is hardcoded into the editor or the contract.

## The UI Layout panel — bevy_ui cost without a Tracy build

Tracy answers "which system", but standing up a profiling build to ask one
question about the editor's own UI is a slow loop. The **UI Layout** panel
(Debug → UI Layout) answers the specific question that kept coming up, live and
with no rebuild: *where is bevy_ui's per-frame cost going?*

It brackets the UI pipeline with three timestamps around the public system sets:

```text
  A ── UiSystems::Prepare ‥ Propagate ‥ Content ── B ── Layout ── C
       └──────── content (text measurement) ──────┘   └─ taffy ─┘
```

and reports the two halves separately, plus a node census (total / hidden / text
/ visible text). The split is the actionable part, because the two halves have
opposite fixes: **content-bound** means fewer or cheaper labels, **taffy-bound**
means fewer nodes. The census refreshes only while the tab is open, and then only
every 30 frames — a panel about frame time should not cost frame time.

Read it against **UI Reactivity**'s `ms/frame recompute`. Whichever is larger is
the one worth optimising, and the answer is usually not the one you expect: the
measured split was **0.23 ms of reactivity against 5.48 ms of UI layout**.

## Standing findings — don't undo these

These results are easy to reverse by accident, because in each case the
*expensive* option looks like the harmless default.

**Watch the filesystem; never poll it from a system.** `host::dev` used to
re-walk every plugin crate's source tree with a recursive `read_dir` every
0.25 s, diffing a map of `(mtime, len)` stamps. Measured on a splash screen with
no project open:

| | polling | `notify` watcher |
|---|---|---|
| `poll_plugin_sources` | 1278.0 µs/frame | **1.8 µs/frame** |
| its max | 31.33 ms | **0.10 ms** |
| frames in the 20.5-24 ms lump | 4.3% | **0.12%** |

351 walks at ~19 ms each across a 96 s capture, none of which found anything,
in every editor session — the install is gated on `is_editor`, not Dev Mode.
`notify` and `notify-debouncer-full` are already in the tree via bevy's
`file_watcher`, so this costs no new dependency; in `renzora_plugin` the dep is
gated behind the `host` feature so a plugin author still resolves to zero
dependencies.

Two details that are easy to get wrong and were both hit here. **Watch `src/`
and `Cargo.toml`, not the crate directory** — each plugin declares its own
`[workspace]` and therefore has its own `target/`, so a recursive watch makes
every rebuild flood the queue with its own build output. Filtering those paths
after delivery is not enough; an overflow drops real events alongside the noise.
And **an overflow must not trigger a rebuild-everything fallback** — a `git
checkout` would then rebuild all 63 plugins, which is the worst possible response
to the moment you least want one.

The remaining poll, `loader::poll_plugin_dir`, is deliberate: it stats one flat
directory of built libraries rather than a tree, and measures 15.6 µs/frame.

**Editor chrome is excluded with a query filter, never a per-entity check.** The
editor's own `bevy_ui` nodes live in the same `World` as the scene — roughly 1500
of them, ~950 of those named, on a completely empty project. Any system that means
"the scene" must therefore say so, and it must say so as a `With`/`Without` filter
so Bevy resolves it **once per archetype**. The rule is: an entity is scene content
unless it is a `bevy_ui` node, and a `bevy_ui` node is scene content only if it is
authored game UI (`UiCanvas`/`UiWidget`). `renzora_hierarchy::state::HierarchyCandidate`
is the canonical spelling.

Two places got this wrong and are worth understanding, because the mistake is
natural:

- `build_entity_tree` looped every archetype, then called `world.get::<Name>(entity)`
  on **every entity in the world** to find the named ones, then made three or four
  more random-access lookups per named entity to discard the chrome. All of that
  information is in the archetype; it was being re-derived per entity, up to 10x/sec,
  in an exclusive system.
- `ScriptComponent` was auto-inserted on every named entity, which meant every named
  UI node. Each insert is a deferred **archetype move** — the entity's whole component
  set is copied to a new table — and chrome respawns in bursts, so one panel rebuild
  became hundreds of archetype moves in a single frame. It also doubled the archetype
  count for UI, since each UI component-set then existed both with and without it.

**Behaviour contract this changes:** *nothing* receives a `ScriptComponent`
automatically any more. The auto-insert observer was first narrowed to skip `bevy_ui`
nodes and has since been removed outright — an empty component on every named entity
still cost an archetype move each and left the executor's `&ScriptComponent` query
walking entities with no scripts on them. Every path that needs the component now
creates it on demand: the inspector's **Scripts** entry, dropping a script or
blueprint file onto an entity, the hierarchy's New Asset menu, saving a blueprint
graph, and `renzora_ember::game_ui`, which still inserts one on `UiWidget`/`UiCanvas`
so `<input bind="Entity.var">` resolves. If you spawn an entity outside those paths
and need script variables on it, insert the component yourself.

**The inspector's Scripts section is nonetheless shown on every entity, and that is
not a regression of the above.** Its `has_fn` is unconditionally `true`, so the
section is inherent to the entity the way 2D Lighting is inherent to a `Camera2d` —
but the section is drawn over an *absent* component, and the add-bar inserts one only
when a script actually lands (removing the last script removes it again). Attaching a
script is among the most common things anyone does in the editor, and routing it
through Add Component → search → drop was pure ceremony in front of the action; the
fix for that is UI-side, and materialising an empty component on every entity to get
it would give back every cost listed above **plus** a `scripts: []` entry serialised
into every saved scene, since the component is registered for reflection. If you ever
want the component genuinely universal, the prerequisite is a marker component that
the executor, the hot-reload pass and the hierarchy's badge change-detection filter
on, so the empty ones sit in archetypes those queries never visit.

**Two costs that scaled with `ScriptComponent` count are also gone.**
`check_script_hot_reload` iterated `&mut ScriptComponent` every 0.5 s, and
`Mut::deref_mut` sets the change tick whether or not the write changes anything — so
every component in the scene was marked `Changed` twice a second. `renzora_hierarchy`'s
`AssetBadgeChanges` watches `Changed<ScriptComponent>` for its script badge, so that
storm set `HierarchyDirty` and forced `build_entity_tree` — a full-world scan on an
exclusive system — to run at 2 Hz forever with nothing changed. It now reads through
the immutable `Deref` and bails before touching `DerefMut` unless something is
genuinely stale. Separately, `scripts_should_run` scanned every `ScriptComponent` to
answer "is any script previewing?", and Bevy evaluates a run condition per system
rather than sharing the result — four systems gate on it, so that was four scans a
frame. The answer now lands in a `ScriptsActive` resource computed once in
`ScriptingSet::PreScript`, and the in-play case returns from `PlayModeState` without
iterating anything.

**`ghost_nodes` is deliberately off.** It's a `bevy_ui` feature that swaps
`UiChildren` for a much slower implementation on the editor's hottest path.
`update_children_recursively` calls `is_changed()` once per UI node per frame, and
it short-circuits only when a node's children actually changed — so in steady state
every node falls through to `iter_ghost_nodes()`, which returns a
`Box<dyn Iterator>`: **one heap allocation per UI node per frame**. With ~5k UI
entities that is the dominant term in `ui_layout_system`. `GhostNode` is used
exactly zero times in the workspace, so we pay it for nothing. Re-enabling it is an
[ABI bump](../extending/plugins.md) *and* a performance regression — only do it if
something genuinely needs `GhostNode`, and measure afterwards.

**`bevy_ui` has no hidden-subtree skip.** It walks the full UI tree three times a
frame unconditionally; `Display::None` does not prune it, and
`compute_hidden_layout` clears the cache and recurses, so hidden subtrees are never
even cached. This is why the dock despawns backgrounded panels rather than hiding
them (see [Panels](panels.md)) — hiding a panel does not make it free, and nothing
in the layout stage will make it free later.

**The inspector culls its off-screen sections, and must keep doing so.** Because
`bevy_ui` never prunes hidden subtrees (above), an open component section that has
scrolled out of the panel still charges a full tree walk every frame. The
inspector therefore throws a section's rows away once its body leaves the viewport
by more than half a screen, and rebuilds them when it scrolls back — the same
fill/unfill machinery collapsing a section already used, applied on a second axis.
Measured on one entity with its components open:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| ms/frame UI layout | 5.48 | **3.36** |
| Layout (taffy) | 4.05 | **2.34** |
| Content (text measure) | 1.43 | **1.01** |
| Nodes total | 2814 | 2433 |

Two invariants hold it together, and both are "don't" rules that fail silently:
a section is **never culled before its height has been measured** (the reserved
height is what stops the list collapsing and the scroll range shifting under the
user), and a body is **never measured while it is not holding its rows** (that
records its padding as the section's height and reserves that forever). Both are
covered by `cull_tests` in `renzora_inspector::native`.

Note that this is *not* built on [`virtual_scroll`](widgets.md), which every other
editor list uses. That windows a `keyed_list` by measuring one row stride and
assuming every item shares it — exact for the asset grid and the hierarchy, and
wrong for the inspector, where a collapsed section is one header and an open one
with a native drawer is hundreds of px. Measuring each section's own height
sidesteps the assumption instead of fighting it.

A note on where to spend effort: across this pass, removing *discrete work*
(a system, a rebuild, a subtree) predicted its measured win 5 times out of 5, while
shaving *per-unit constants* on work that still ran predicted it 0 times out of 3.
If a change doesn't remove something from the frame entirely, be sceptical of the
estimate until Tracy confirms it.

## Runtime UI scale

Runtime UI scale still checks the current canvas and display size each frame,
but only writes the global scale when the calculated value differs. This avoids
unchanged-scale change notifications without relying on cached resize events.
The regression workload measures notifications across 1,000 stable frames and
window/canvas changes; it is not an FPS benchmark.

## Collision snapshots

Collision snapshots expose only the first contact that entered and the first
that exited during a frame. Both physics backends now stop each difference
iterator at that first contact, avoiding temporary lists of unused contacts.
The contact sets are still checked every frame; this is not an event-driven
physics rewrite or a measured FPS improvement. Contact ordering remains
unspecified, as before.

Contact-name strings retain capacity across enter/exit notifications. A
two-entity regression checks 1,000 alternating contact frames without growing
the warmed name buffers. Longer names can still grow those buffers; their
capacity is retained until the component is dropped.

Both backends compare live contacts against the prior snapshot before rebuilding
the contact set. Unchanged contacts keep that set, while one-frame flags and
names still clear. A 1,000-frame stable-contact regression performs zero rebuilds.
Contact traversal still happens each frame, and a transition can require a
second traversal to collect the replacement set. This is not an event-driven
update or a measured FPS improvement.

Velocity mirrors still read the current backend every frame, but only mark
`PhysicsReadState` changed when the velocity or speed bits differ. Missing
velocities still reset the reading to zero, and switching between 2D and 3D
still selects the correct backend. Grounded state is untouched. A headless
regression observes zero extra change notifications across 1,000 stable frames
per backend; this does not measure FPS or eliminate the velocity calculation.

## Plugin material settings

Plugin materials cache the entity groups that contain their settings instead
of searching every entity for each material. New groups are included as the
scene changes. The collector preserves the previous first-source ordering,
including disabled sources, and keeps the last uniform when no source exists.
It reuses its working lists and copies directly into uniforms only when bytes
change; unused materials no longer walk unrelated entities. Removed materials
release their unused cached queries.

The headless regression compares a scan of over 10,000 unrelated entities with
zero matching groups in the cached path, and checks 100 stable updates. This
measures avoided search work, not editor FPS or GPU timing.

## Script execution storage

Script execution temporarily owns only the entry list; it leaves the component
and its ID allocator attached to the entity. Runtime state returns to the same
list storage after hooks finish. Script commands remain deferred. A 1,000-update
regression observes zero component removals and preserves initialization and
disabled entries. The reflection read handlers share one immutable name lookup
per pass rather than cloning that map for each handler. Other public context
snapshots are still owned copies; this is not a complete snapshot redesign.

## Hidden System Profiler

The System Profiler refreshes its view data only while its tab is active in a
main, fixed or floating dock. Its existing refresh interval remains in effect.
Underlying diagnostic capture stays enabled; only the view's sorting, formatting
and entity-count scans are gated. The headless gate regression checks 1,000
hidden updates and resumption in the main and fixed docks.

## Tile maintenance

Tile-object baking queries changed, unbaked or explicitly waiting objects.
Successfully baked objects leave the working set until edited. The waiting
marker preserves retries when a replacement atlas loads after the object's
change tick expires. A headless workload checks zero baker visits across 1,000
settled frames and successful re-baking after an edit.

Tileset sampler repair considers changed handles and image-added/modified/loaded
messages. Settled frames with no image messages visit only changed handles;
late loads and another consumer changing the sampler still trigger repair.
