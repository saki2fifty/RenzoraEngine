# Cross-Compilation

Every Renzora target is cross-compiled inside Docker, so your host only needs Docker to produce Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly builds. The toolchain is split into a shared base image plus one image per platform, so you download only the toolchains you actually build.

## One image per platform, on a shared base

Renzora does **not** use `cross`, `mingw`, or per-host linker juggling. Cross builds happen inside the engine's prebuilt images, published under **`ghcr.io/renzora/*`**:

| Image | Adds on top of base |
|---|---|
| `base` (`docker/base/Dockerfile`, `FROM rust:1.95.0-bookworm`) | rust + Linux dev libs + LLVM-19 |
| `linux` | appimagetool + dual-arch cross-gcc + UPX |
| `windows` | xwin (MSVC SDK + CRT) |
| `macos` | osxcross + macOS SDK + rcodesign |
| `ios` | osxcross + iPhoneOS SDK |
| `android` | Android NDK |
| `wasm` | wasm-bindgen + binaryen |

Each platform image builds `FROM base`, so they share the base layer on pull (downloaded once, stored once) while a toolchain change to one platform never re-downloads the others. The `renzora` CLI pulls only what a command needs: `renzora run` pulls the host platform image; `renzora build` (no args) pulls all; `renzora build windows` pulls only Windows. The GPU editor and game still run **natively** from the `dist/` output; only the *build* happens in the container.

The base image is the source of truth for the **container's** Rust version; a `rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo root pins the same version for native `cargo renzora` builds — keep the two in lockstep. Bumping the compiler means editing the `FROM rust:1.95.0-bookworm` line in `docker/base/Dockerfile` (and `rust-toolchain.toml`). Tags are content hashes (`baseTag = sha256(docker/base/Dockerfile)`, `<plat>Tag = sha256(baseTag + docker/<plat>/Dockerfile)`), so a base edit re-rolls **every** platform tag — the CLI re-pulls and CI rebuilds each platform on the new base — while a platform-only edit moves just that platform's tag.

> Ignore older guides that mention `cargo install cross`, `gcc-mingw-w64`, `aarch64-apple-ios-sim` via Xcode, or hand-editing `~/.cargo/config.toml` per target. None of that applies — the container already contains a configured linker and SDK for every supported triple.

## Supported targets

| Platform | Rust target | Toolchain | Linker |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux x64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | native (container) | `clang` + `mold` |
| Linux ARM64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | GNU cross-gcc (container) | `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` wrapper |
| Windows x64 | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | **xwin** (MSVC SDK + CRT) | `rust-lld` (LLVM `lld`) |
| Windows ARM64 | `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` | **native MSVC only** — not the container | `rust-lld` (LLVM `lld`) |
| macOS x64 | `x86_64-apple-darwin` | **osxcross** | osxcross darwin `clang` |
| macOS ARM64 | `aarch64-apple-darwin` | **osxcross** | osxcross darwin `clang` |
| iOS ARM64 | `aarch64-apple-ios` (+ `-sim`) | **osxcross** iPhoneOS SDK | `clang-19` wrapper |
| Android ARM64 | `aarch64-linux-android` | **Android NDK r27c** | NDK `android33-clang` |
| Android x86_64 | `x86_64-linux-android` | **Android NDK r27c** | NDK `android33-clang` |
| Web (WASM) | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | `wasm-bindgen` + `binaryen` | (none — `wasm-bindgen`) |

> **The two Linux rows are host-relative.** One `renzora build linux` emits *both* desktop Linux arches from one container: whichever arch the container itself runs on builds natively with `clang` + `mold`, and the other is true cross-compilation through the GNU cross-gcc the image installs for it (rustc runs at native speed and emits foreign code — no emulation). So on the usual x86_64 host the table reads exactly as written; on an arm64 host the two swap roles. The cross arch is **best-effort**: if it fails to link, `build-all.sh` prints a `WARN` and the native arch still ships.

> **Windows ARM64 is not a container target.** The only MSVC pieces Microsoft permits redistributing — so `xwin` can bake them into a public image — are the CRT and the Windows SDK, which leaves `clang` as the C compiler. `clang` cannot fully stand in for MSVC on ARM64: it emits MSVC NEON intrinsics (`neon_*`) as undefined externals that no redistributable lib provides, which is an unwinnable per-crate hunt. `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` is therefore built **natively**, with the real MSVC toolchain — see [Continuous integration](#continuous-integration) below. Windows-on-ARM users who don't want a native build can run the x64 binary under Windows 11's built-in x64 emulation.

> **tvOS / Apple TV is not a supported target.** The image installs no `aarch64-apple-tvos` rustup target and `docker/build-all.sh` has no tvOS lane. Orphan `cargo build-tvos` / `build-tvos-sim` aliases exist in `.cargo/config.toml`, but the container cannot build them — tvOS is aspirational, not shippable.

## The bundled toolchains

The image builds each toolchain at image-build time so it is fully self-contained. The C/C++ compiler triples (used by `cc`-style build scripts) are exported from `/etc/osxcross-env.sh`, which `docker/build-all.sh` sources before any build.

### Windows — xwin

Windows is built for the **MSVC ABI** (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`), not GNU/mingw. [`xwin`](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin) (v0.6.5) downloads the redistributable Visual Studio Build Tools CRT + Windows SDK into `/xwin` at image-build time. Combined with rustc's MSVC support, `clang-cl`, `lld-link`, and `llvm-lib` (all from LLVM 19), this gives a fully Linux→Windows-MSVC pipeline.

```toml
# container linker config (generated in the image)
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
rustflags = [
    "-Lnative=/xwin/crt/lib/x86_64",
    "-Lnative=/xwin/sdk/lib/um/x86_64",
    "-Lnative=/xwin/sdk/lib/ucrt/x86_64",
]
```

> The repo pins the Windows linker to `rust-lld` (rustc's bundled `lld`). Engine code is statically linked; no Bevy DLL is shipped. Native dependencies may still require the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

### macOS & iOS — osxcross

macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin` + `aarch64-apple-darwin`) and iOS (`aarch64-apple-ios`) are cross-compiled with [osxcross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross). The image fetches the macOS SDK (`MacOSX26.1.sdk`) and the iPhoneOS SDK (`iPhoneOS15.5.sdk`), then builds osxcross's clang toolchain. Deployment targets default to macOS **11.0** and iOS **14.0**.

- **macOS** links with osxcross's `*-apple-darwin*-clang` and embeds an `@loader_path` rpath so the binary finds its sibling dylibs.
- **iOS** is compiled by a small `aarch64-apple-ios-clang` wrapper that invokes `clang-19 --target=arm64-apple-ios14.0 -isysroot /opt/iphoneos.sdk -fuse-ld=lld` (osxcross's macOS clang wrapper hardcodes `-mmacosx-version-min`, which conflicts with the iOS minimum).

> macOS lanes build **only if osxcross is present** in the image; otherwise `build-all.sh` prints a warning and skips them. The community SDK mirrors used by the Dockerfile are not license-clean — for production, regenerate the SDK tarballs from Xcode on a Mac and re-point the SDK URLs.

### Android — NDK r27c

Android (`aarch64-linux-android` + `x86_64-linux-android`) uses the Android **NDK r27c** at `/opt/android-ndk`, targeting **API level 33**. Each target links with the matching NDK clang (e.g. `aarch64-linux-android33-clang`). The Android build produces a `cdylib` from `renzora-android` whose library name is `main` → **`libmain.so`**.

### WebAssembly — wasm-bindgen + binaryen

The web runtime target (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) is built and post-processed separately from the web editor:

1. `cargo build` emits `renzora.wasm`.
2. `wasm-bindgen` (v0.2.108) generates the JS glue: `renzora-runtime.js` + `renzora-runtime_bg.wasm` (`--target web`).
3. `wasm-opt` (from `binaryen`) shrinks the module with `-Oz` and the feature flags the runtime needs (`bulk-memory`, `sign-ext`, `reference-types`, `multivalue`, …).

> The build script has separate runtime and editor Wasm lanes. Neither loads a desktop editor DLL or native C-ABI library. Desktop Rust extension loading is not implied by a successful web build; browser capabilities remain target-specific.

## Building with `renzora build`

`renzora build [platform ...]` runs the cross build inside the container and writes into `dist/` (it wraps `docker/build-all.sh` under the hood). Pass no platforms to build everything the image can produce, or a filtered list:

```bash
# Build specific platforms into dist/
renzora build windows linux

# Build everything the container can produce
renzora build
```

### Platform tokens

| Token | Expands to | Output directory |
|---|---|---|
| `linux` | `linux-x64` + `linux-arm64` | `dist/linux-x64/`, `dist/linux-arm64/` |
| `linux-x64` / `linux-arm64` | that arch only, if the container can produce it | the matching dir |
| `windows` | Windows x64 (MSVC) | `dist/windows-x64/` |
| `macos` | `macos-x64` + `macos-arm64` | `dist/macos-x64/`, `dist/macos-arm64/` |
| `macos-x64` | macOS x64 only | `dist/macos-x64/` |
| `macos-arm64` | macOS ARM64 only | `dist/macos-arm64/` |
| `wasm` | Web runtime | `dist/web-wasm32/` |
| `android` | `android-arm64` + `android-x86` | `dist/android-arm64/`, `dist/android-x86/` |
| `android-arm64` | Android ARM64 only | `dist/android-arm64/` |
| `android-x86` | Android x86_64 only | `dist/android-x86/` |
| `ios` | iOS ARM64 | `dist/ios-arm64/` |

Output directories are **arch-suffixed**, and the names do not match the README's flat `dist/<platform>/`. Desktop targets place the binary and its shared libraries **directly** in the platform dir; web and mobile targets nest their output under a `runtime/` subdirectory.

### Lane orchestration

Builds run as concurrent **lanes**, where the contention-free unit is the *feature* (each owns its own `--target-dir`), not the platform:

- The **desktop lane** builds the engine for every requested desktop platform into `target/editor/`. The desktop platforms inside that lane build sequentially (they share the target-dir and reuse host-side proc-macro/build-script artifacts).
- The **`wasm`**, **`android`**, and **`ios`** lanes each build into their own `target/{wasm,android,ios}/` and run concurrently with the desktop lane.

Concurrency is capped by `BUILD_JOBS` (env), defaulting to ~one lane per 4 GB of container RAM and clamped to the CPU count, because parallel Bevy builds are RAM-bound during codegen/link. On a memory-tight machine set `BUILD_JOBS=1`.

> The desktop lane is **required** (its failure fails the build); the `android` and `ios` lanes are **best-effort** — a failure there prints a `WARN` and is reported in the lane summary but does not fail the overall build. macOS is skipped entirely if osxcross is missing.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/build-engine.yml` runs the same cross-compile in CI. It is **manual only** — a `workflow_dispatch` with a `platform` choice (`all`, `linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `wasm`), never a `push` trigger. A full build costs hours of runner time across several jobs, and the artefacts are export templates you want at release time, not on every commit; CI's per-commit gate is `test.yml` (`cargo test` + `cargo clippy -D warnings`), which is a different job with a different budget.

Run it from the Actions tab, or:

```bash
gh workflow run build-engine.yml -f platform=all
```

Each container job pulls its toolchain image from GHCR, mounts the checkout at `/app/src` (where the CLI puts it, so cargo resolves **both** the repo's `.cargo/config.toml` and the image's `/app/.cargo` cross-linker sections), and runs `docker/build-all.sh` — the exact path `renzora build <platform>` takes. It pulls `:latest` rather than the content-hash tag because this workflow and `docker-image.yml` are independent, so the hash-tagged image for the current Dockerfile may not be published yet.

| Job | Runner | Produces | Artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build (linux)` | `ubuntu-latest` + linux image | `dist/linux-x64/`, `dist/linux-arm64/` | `renzora-linux` |
| `build (windows)` | `ubuntu-latest` + windows image | `dist/windows-x64/` | `renzora-windows` |
| `build (macos)` | `ubuntu-latest` + macos image | `dist/macos-x64/`, `dist/macos-arm64/` | `renzora-macos` |
| `build (wasm)` | `ubuntu-latest` + wasm image | `dist/web-wasm32/` | `renzora-wasm` |
| `windows-arm64` | `windows-11-arm` (native) | `dist/windows-arm64/` | `renzora-windows-arm64` |

Two details worth knowing:

- **`windows-arm64` is not a container job.** For the reason given under [Supported targets](#supported-targets), that slice needs the real MSVC toolchain, so it runs natively on a GitHub-hosted `windows-11-arm` runner (free for public repos) via `cargo renzora dist` — the same xtask a contributor uses locally, which stages the identical layout `build-all.sh` produces. Because the host target *is* `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`, nothing there is cross-compiled and no `rustup target add` is needed; the runner image ships no Rust, so the job installs `rustup` and lets `rust-toolchain.toml` pin the channel.
- **`fail-fast` is off.** One platform failing must not cancel the others — a macOS SDK hiccup shouldn't throw away a two-hour Linux build that already succeeded.

## Output layout

A native desktop editor distribution includes the executable pair and required companions. For example:

```
dist/windows-x64/
├── renzora-editor.exe       # editor
├── renzora.exe              # game / server runtime
├── rust-sdk/                # small guest source SDK
└── plugins/                 # standalone C-ABI plugins
```

Linux and macOS use `renzora-editor` and `renzora`, without `.exe`. Default builds do not need shared Bevy, contract or Rust standard-library images. Docker runtime-only outputs omit the editor; an installed engine-extension release also needs its matching build kit. Non-desktop runtime artifacts remain target-specific:

| Target | Artifact | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Web | `renzora-runtime.js` + `renzora-runtime_bg.wasm` | `dist/web-wasm32/` |
| Android | `libmain.so` | `dist/android-arm64/`, `dist/android-x86/` |
| iOS | `librenzora_ios.a` (staticlib) | `dist/ios-arm64/` |

On Linux, the editor output is additionally wrapped into an `AppDir` and packaged as `Renzora Engine-x86_64.AppImage` when `appimagetool` is available.

### Keep the required companions together

Ordinary plugins use a negotiated C ABI and share no Bevy types across the library boundary. Engine extensions are compiled into replacement executables. Rust `TypeId` equality is not the compatibility mechanism for standalone plugins.

Keep the selected standalone libraries, assets and any required platform companions (such as the OpenXR loader) with the runtime. Static engine linking does not remove operating-system library requirements. Do not add old SDK libraries from a warm Cargo cache to a new static package.

## `build.rs` and cross-compilation

The root `build.rs` adapts to whether it is building natively or cross-compiling to Windows:

- On a **Windows host** it embeds the icon/version resource via `winres`.
- When **cross-compiling Linux→Windows-MSVC** it hand-writes a `.rc` file and invokes `llvm-rc` (LLVM 19, in the image) to compile it.

It also emits two values used by the dynamic-plugin ABI guard, regardless of target:

- `RENZORA_ENGINE_VERSION` — the package version.
- `RENZORA_BUILD_HASH` — an FNV-1a hash of `"<version>-<rustc>-bevy0.19"`. The loader **rejects** any plugin whose hash differs, so a plugin built against a different compiler or engine version is refused rather than crashing. (This is why every build uses the same `dist` profile and the same containerized compiler.)

## Single-target cross builds

To build just one target, pass its platform token to `renzora build` — everything still runs inside the container, so the host needs only Docker:

```bash
renzora build wasm           # wasm32 game runtime
renzora build android        # aarch64-linux-android
renzora build ios            # aarch64-apple-ios staticlib
```

These write into the arch-suffixed `dist/` layout and run the full `wasm-bindgen` / AppImage / shared-lib-copy post-processing.

> `cargo build-tvos` / `build-tvos-sim` exist but cannot build — there is no tvOS target or SDK in the toolchain (see the note above).
