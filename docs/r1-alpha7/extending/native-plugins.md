# Native Plugins (full World)

A **native plugin** is an ordinary Bevy plugin, shipped as Rust source, compiled on the machine that installs it, and loaded by the editor at startup. It gets `&mut World`. Not a filtered view of it, not a command vocabulary — the same access an exclusive system has.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

pub struct MyPlugin;

impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_systems(Update, my_system);
    }
}

fn my_system(mut q: Query<&mut Transform>) { /* … */ }

renzora::plugin!(MyPlugin);
```

That last line is the only Renzora-specific thing about it. Everything above it is a Bevy plugin you could have written for any Bevy app.

## Which kind of plugin do I want?

Renzora has two plugin mechanisms and they are not competing — they serve different deployments.

| | **Native plugin** | **[Standalone C-ABI plugin](standalone-plugins.md)** |
|---|---|---|
| Crate type | `dylib` | `cdylib` |
| Links Bevy | yes, the engine's own | no |
| Access | full `&mut World`, any Bevy API | a fixed function table |
| Typical size | 100–500 KB | 20–100 KB |
| Ships as | source, compiled on install | a prebuilt binary |
| Runs in a shipped game | yes, at `Runtime` scope — copy-based exports only | yes, every export mode |
| Runs on wasm / mobile | **no** | yes |
| Needs the plugin SDK | yes | no |

**A native plugin is not editor-only.** Declare it `Runtime` (see [Scope](#scope-editor-or-the-game-too)) and the export copies the built library beside the game, which works because a copy-based export carries the very `bevy_dylib` and `renzora_dylib` the plugin was compiled against.

Where a native plugin genuinely cannot go is narrower than "a game":

- **A lean single-binary export.** It links Bevy statically and shares no image, so there is nothing for a plugin library to bind to; native plugins are skipped there entirely.
- **wasm and mobile**, which have no dylibs to load at all.
- **Another platform.** Staged libraries are host-shaped, so an export for a platform you are not sitting on ships no native plugins.

Rule of thumb, then: **a native plugin is the right shape for anything that wants the real `World`** — a panel, a tool, a validator, an importer, a viewport gizmo, and equally a gameplay system in a copy-based game. Reach for C-ABI when the thing must survive every export mode: a post-process effect, a script language, an audio or network backend, or anything a lean, wasm or cross-compiled build still needs.

## Scope: editor, or the game too

A native plugin says where it may load, the same way an in-workspace plugin does:

```rust
renzora::plugin!(MyTool);            // Editor only — the default
renzora::plugin!(MySystems, Runtime); // Also loaded by a shipped game
```

`Runtime` works for the reason the editor's own loading works: a game exported by the copy-based modes ships the very `bevy_dylib` and `renzora_dylib` the plugin was compiled against, so the `World` on both sides of the boundary is one type. The export copies the library the editor already built, so the player needs no SDK and no Rust toolchain — only the game.

Only the library ships, not `src/`. The loader treats a directory holding a built library and nothing else as a plugin it can load but not rebuild, which is exactly a shipped game's situation — so a plugin author's source does not end up inside every game that uses their plugin.

The scope is read from the **built library**, not from the source. A `plugin!(.., Runtime)` in `src/lib.rs` describes what the source would build to; what ships is the library, and the two disagree whenever one was edited without rebuilding. An editor-only plugin is named in the export log rather than quietly left out, since "my plugin is missing from the build" is otherwise indistinguishable from a bug.

The exception is a **lean single-binary** export. That links Bevy statically and shares no image, so there is nothing for a plugin library to bind to. A `Runtime` native plugin is skipped there, exactly as a Rust script is — which is why scripts are compiled *into* a lean binary rather than loaded (see [Rust Scripts](../scripting/rust-scripts.md)).

`Editor` is the default deliberately. It is what every native plugin written before scopes existed was, so those keep behaving as they did; and it is the safe way to guess, because an editor plugin missing from a game is an absence, while a runtime plugin that should not have shipped is in the player's hands. A plugin built before this existed exports no scope symbol at all, and the loader reads that as `Editor` for the same reason.

A plugin is exclusively one or the other. A feature that needs editor tooling on top of runtime behaviour ships two plugins — the same rule `add!` follows.

## Layout

Both kinds live in `plugins/`. A native plugin is a **directory**; a C-ABI plugin is a loose library file. The two loaders never collide.

```
<editor dir>/
  bevy_dylib-<hash>.dll     renzora_dylib.dll     renzora_ember_dylib.dll
  sdk/                                            the plugin SDK, optional
  plugins/
    grayscale.dll                                 C-ABI: prebuilt, 52 KB
    my-plugin/                                    native: shipped as source
      Cargo.toml
      src/lib.rs
      build/my_plugin.dll                         what rustc produced
      build/stamp.txt                             what it was built against
```

`src/lib.rs` is what makes a directory a plugin. Submodules work — `src/ui/panel.rs` and deeper are staged and watched.

## Building

From a source checkout, `cargo renzora` builds every native plugin under `plugins/` as part of staging. From a downloaded editor, there is nothing to run: the editor compiles a plugin the first time it sees one, and again whenever the engine moves under it.

**Do not run `cargo build` in a native plugin directory.** `plugins/` sits outside the engine workspace, so cargo would resolve it a fresh Bevy from crates.io — a different compilation with different `TypeId`s. The result builds cleanly, loads, and corrupts the World. The `bevy` and `renzora` entries in your `Cargo.toml` are there so rust-analyzer can resolve them while you author, and so Bevy's derive macros can read the manifest; the plugin itself is compiled by `rustc` against the SDK, and cargo is never pointed at those entries. (Your *other* dependencies are built by cargo — from a stripped manifest that mentions no Bevy. See [Crates from crates.io](#crates-from-cratesio).)

### The SDK

Compiling against the engine you already have needs what `rustc` reads at compile time — crate metadata, proc-macro dylibs, native import libraries. That is the **plugin SDK**.

It rides inside the engine download as a single compressed `sdk.tar.zst` (~444 MB) beside the executables, and is unpacked to `sdk/` once per update. Rust scripts need it as much as plugins do, so that unpack is part of setting the engine up rather than an optional extra. Bundling it rather than fetching it from somewhere is deliberate: there is no URL, no resume, no checksum and no offline case to handle, and a version mismatch is structurally impossible because the SDK in the folder is by construction the one that built the editor next to it.

zstd rather than xz, even though xz is 103 MB smaller: unpacking is on everyone's path now, so its cost is paid by every user while the download's is paid once. Measured, that trade buys a 29.8 s unpack down to ~2 s of decode, and removes a 1.9 GB temporary file along the way.

The metadata is staged as `.rmeta` files rather than the `.rlib` archives cargo produced. An `.rlib` holds two things — the crate's metadata and its compiled object code — and a plugin build consumes only the first: it typechecks against the metadata and takes the *code* from the three shared images (`bevy_dylib`, `renzora_dylib`, `renzora_ember_dylib`), which is what those exist for. Dropping the object half is what takes the extracted SDK from 3.3 GB to 1.5 GB, with byte-identical plugins out the other end.

This is safe because `rustc` will not link a crate's code from thin air. Under `-C prefer-dynamic` a crate whose objects are already inside a dylib being linked is taken from there; anything else demands its archive and says so — `error[E0461]: crate 'X' required to be available in rlib format`. There is no quiet failure. The one crate staged whole is the `bevy` facade itself: it lives inside `renzora_dylib` rather than `bevy_dylib`, so a plugin that imported `bevy` and touched nothing else would hit E0461 from metadata alone. That plugin could never load anyway — `renzora::plugin!` writes the symbol the loader looks for — but 42 KB buys the simpler rule, so `bevy` keeps its `.rlib`.

Without it, an already-built plugin still loads. What is lost is the ability to build or rebuild one.

The SDK is pinned to one exact `rustc` — Rust's crate metadata format is versioned and the compiler refuses another version's. The editor checks this before compiling and tells you which toolchain to install, rather than letting you find out from `error[E0514]`.

### The SDK cannot be cross-built

An SDK for a platform is only correct when it was built **on** that platform. This is a property of how Rust compiles, not a gap in the tooling, and it is the one thing to know before you distribute an editor you built for somebody else's operating system.

The reason is proc-macro dylibs. A proc macro runs *inside* `rustc`, so it is compiled for the machine running the compiler rather than for the machine the code is aimed at. Cross-compile the engine for Windows from a Linux box and cargo does exactly what it should: it emits Windows metadata for every ordinary crate, and Linux `.so` proc macros, because Linux is where the compiler ran. Ship that pair to a Windows user and their `rustc` cannot load half of it.

What they see is a wall of errors that looks like the script is wrong. It is not. The first line is the only real one:

```
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `bevy_derive` which `bevy_app` depends on
```

`bevy_derive` is a proc macro, so it is missing; `bevy_app` therefore will not load; `bevy` will not load either — and everything behind `bevy::prelude` disappears at once. `cannot find macro info`, `cannot find derive macro Component`, `cannot find type Transform`, and so on for every name the script used.

You cannot repair such an SDK by dropping in proc macros from a real Windows build. Each `.rmeta` records the exact hash of the dependencies it was compiled against, so `rustc` rejects a proc macro that did not come out of the same compilation. Two of them are the engine's own — `renzora_macros` and `renzora_plugin_derive` — so a fork's macros differ from anyone else's and no shared or downloaded set could stand in. The metadata and the proc macros have to come from one build, on one machine, whose own platform is the platform being built for.

Rather than ship an editor that fails this way, the build system does not produce one. Each of the three ways to build has a job it can actually do:

| | Builds | Editor + SDK |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo renzora` | the platform you are sitting on | yes, and correct by construction |
| Docker (`renzora build <platform>`) | runtimes / export templates, any platform | no — never staged |
| CI native lanes | one runner per platform | yes, one per platform |

So a container's desktop lane now stages the game runtime and stops. The editor binary is still compiled — it comes along with `--workspace` — and then deliberately left behind. macOS from Linux was always affected exactly as Windows was; there is nothing Windows-specific here beyond it being the case people hit first.

**This costs the export path nothing**, which matters if you maintain a fork. A game needs no SDK — it ships plugins that were already compiled — so cross-built runtimes are correct, and those runtimes *are* the export templates `renzora_export` looks for. Building your own templates for platforms you do not own is exactly what Docker is for, and it works. Of the three plugin mechanisms only this one is affected at all: C-ABI plugins link no Bevy and need no SDK, and Lua is interpreted.

**What you cannot do is hand someone an editor for an operating system you do not have.** For that, use a hosted runner — free on a public repository, and no container involved: the lane runs `cargo renzora dist` natively, exactly as you would locally. `windows-arm64` in `.github/workflows/build-engine.yml` is the working template, and a fork inherits it with the repository.

### Staleness and rebuilds

A plugin is bound to one engine build. Its metadata, its `TypeId`s and its imports all come from that build's artifacts, so a plugin built against a different engine is not "probably fine" — it is memory corruption with no diagnostic.

So each build records a **stamp**: a content hash of the shared images the plugin links, plus the rustc version. On load the editor compares. A mismatch rebuilds — about a second, and invisible — rather than loading.

This is the property that makes source-shipped plugins better than prebuilt ones. Update the engine and every installed plugin quietly rebuilds itself against the new one. Nothing has to be republished, and no plugin silently rots.

Editing `src/` rebuilds too, on the next launch. That is the whole iteration loop for someone working from a downloaded editor with no repository and no `cargo`.

## Turning plugins on and off

**Settings → Editor → Plugins** lists every plugin the engine found this launch — both kinds, in one list — with a switch each and a line saying what actually happened to it: *Active*, *Disabled*, a reason it was skipped, or the error it failed with.

The list is built from what the loaders reported, not from a directory scan, so it always matches what the engine really did. A plugin that failed to compile shows the first line of the error there and the whole thing in the Console.

**Changes take effect at the next launch.** That is structural rather than unfinished: a plugin adds systems, resources and function pointers to the `App` while it is being assembled, and Bevy cannot withdraw them. Unmapping the image is worse — a retired system is still *in* the schedule, merely returning early. So the switch records intent, and the loader acts on it at startup.

A disabled plugin costs nothing at all: it is skipped before the directory is touched, so there is no rebuild if its stamp is stale, no `dlopen`, and none of its static initializers run. That matters when you are disabling one to find out whether it is the plugin breaking your editor — half-running it would tell you nothing.

The list lives in `~/.renzora/editor.toml` under `disabled_plugins`, keyed by a native plugin's directory name or a standalone plugin's library stem (with any `lib` prefix stripped, so the same file is named the same thing on every platform). It is hand-editable if you have managed to disable the plugin that draws the settings panel.

## What you can reach

Three crates, and they are enough for almost anything:

- **`bevy`** — all of it. Queries, assets, schedules, render, UI, gizmos, `bsn!`.
- **`renzora`** — the contract crate. Every type that crosses a boundary in this engine lives here on purpose, so a plugin shares them rather than mirroring them: `EditorSelection`, `PlayModeState`, `SplashState`, `CurrentProject`, `lang::t()`, the Console buffer, the post-process framework, the shell registries. See **[Editor Features from Code](editor-api.md)** for what each of those registries does.
- **`renzora_ember`** — the editor's UI framework. See **[Editor Panels from a Plugin](panels.md)**.

Anything else in the workspace is not reachable. If your plugin needs a type from another `renzora_*` crate, that type belongs in `renzora` — that is the rule the engine's own crates follow.

### What "belongs in `renzora`" actually means

The **vocabulary** moves; the **implementation** stays. That distinction is what
keeps the contract crate from swallowing the engine, and it is worth internalising
before proposing a move.

`renzora::net` is the model. The `Request`/`Response` types and the submission
queue are in the contract crate, so anything can *ask* for an HTTP call — but no
socket is opened there. The client lives behind the C-ABI boundary in
`plugins/http`. Same shape, one subsystem over: `renzora::audio` holds `AudioLink`
and the play/stop request types, while Kira stays in an audio backend plugin and
the mixer, emitters and timeline stay in `renzora_audio`. `renzora::grid` holds
the two grid components; the render pipeline stays in `renzora_grid`.

So the test for a candidate is:

- **Does a second consumer exist, or does a plugin genuinely need it?** A contract
  is a public API you cannot cheaply change — the C-ABI major version is already
  at 4 because two releases got an append wrong. Do not design one speculatively.
- **Can it move without bringing dependencies?** The contract crate's dep list is
  `bevy` + serialization + the plugin ABI crate, deliberately, so that adding a
  feature crate can never introduce a cycle. If the move would drag Kira or a
  shader compiler in, you are moving an implementation and should stop.
- **Is it feature-gated?** Domain modules here (`text_mesh`, `grid`, `audio`) sit
  behind a cargo feature so a lean export compiles only what it uses.

If the answer to the second question is no but a plugin still needs the capability,
the shape you want is usually a **request type in the contract plus a system in the
owning crate that services it** — the plugin posts, the subsystem performs.

### Crates from crates.io

Add them to your plugin's `Cargo.toml` like any Rust project:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.19"
renzora = { path = "../../crates/renzora" }

noise = "0.9"        # ← an ordinary crates.io dependency
```

That is all.

**How it can be that simple, given `cargo build` here would corrupt the World.** It would — and nothing here runs cargo on your manifest. The build reads your `[dependencies]`, strips `bevy` and every `renzora*`, and writes what is left into a **separate manifest that mentions no Bevy**. Cargo builds *that*, and the resulting rlibs are handed to your plugin's `rustc` as extra `--extern`s, alongside Bevy and the contract crate which still come from the SDK. Cargo resolves `noise`; cargo never resolves Bevy. The hazard isn't avoided by discipline, it is unreachable.

**A dependency that itself depends on Bevy is refused**, with a message naming it. The graph is resolved before anything compiles, so that costs seconds rather than a half-hour build of a Bevy that must not exist. If you need such a crate, use a [C-ABI plugin](standalone-plugins.md) — it shares no types with the engine and may depend on anything.

**A duplicate crate is usually harmless.** Depend on something the engine also links and you get a second, privately linked copy. That matters only for crates holding process-global state — which is exactly why `renzora` and `renzora_ember` are shared images and not ordinary dependencies. And if such a type tried to cross into an engine API, the two copies are different types to the compiler: a compile error, not silent corruption.

**`serde` is the exception, and it will bite you.** Write `serde = "1"` in your manifest and derive `Serialize` on a component holding any Bevy type, and it does not compile:

```
error[E0277]: the trait bound `bevy::prelude::Vec3: serde::Deserialize<'de>`
              is not satisfied
```

`Vec3` implements the *engine's* `Serialize`, not the copy cargo just resolved for you. Use the contract crate's re-export instead, and point the derive at it:

```rust
use renzora::serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(crate = "renzora::serde")]
#[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct MySettings { pub tint: Vec3 }
```

The `#[serde(crate = ...)]` line is required: the derive emits absolute paths, and without it they point at a `serde` your plugin does not have. A plugin whose only third-party need was serde then declares **no** dependencies at all, so cargo is never invoked for it and the build stays offline and about a second long.

Two things to know. Dependencies must be written **one per line** (`foo = { version = "1" }`); the `[dependencies.foo]` sub-table form is refused rather than silently ignored. And this is the one part of plugin building that needs a **network** — the SDK is otherwise entirely offline. A plugin that declares no third-party crates never invokes cargo at all and keeps the offline, one-second build.

## Things that will catch you once

**Spawn on `OnEnter(SplashState::Editor)`, not `Startup`.** The project-load teardown despawns everything carrying a `Name`, and it runs *after* `Startup`. A named entity spawned in `Startup` appears and then vanishes.

**But do give scene content a `Name`.** The hierarchy panel queries `(Entity, &Name)` — no name, no row, nothing to click, no selection and no gizmo. And the scene serializer only writes named entities, so an unnamed mesh is gone after a reload.

**An unnamed entity with a `Transform` is despawned in a shipped game.** `reject_unnamed_entities` treats "has a `Transform`, has no `Name`" as the definition of scene content that lost track of itself, and despawns it. It enforces **always** in an exported game — `EditorSession` is absent, which is how the engine knows it is a game — but in the editor only during play mode.

That asymmetry is what makes this expensive to find: a plugin that spawns a helper mesh works perfectly while you author, and the same plugin flickers in the export, because the guard despawns the helper and your system rebuilds it every frame.

If the thing you spawned is **chrome** rather than scene content — a camera-centred dome, a debug volume, a generated helper that is rebuilt from scratch each run — mark it and it is left alone:

```rust
commands.spawn((
    Mesh3d(mesh),
    MeshMaterial3d(material),
    transform,
    renzora::HideInHierarchy,   // ← or the guard will despawn this in a game
));
```

Prefer `HideInHierarchy` over giving it a `Name`: a name silences the guard too, but names are what `save_scene` serialises, so a transient helper would be written into every saved scene. `Persistent` is the other sanctioned opt-out, for entities on a global scene that *should* appear in the hierarchy.

**`bsn!` parses component arguments as literal values.** `Mesh3d(mesh.clone())` fails with "Unexpected input after function name". Clone into a named binding first.

**The editor contract is glob-re-exported at the crate root.** Write `renzora::EditorSelection`, never `renzora::editor_contract::EditorSelection`.

**rustc's diagnostics name `renzora_dylib` and `renzora_ember_dylib`.** Those are the shared images' real crate names; the `--extern` alias hides them everywhere except error messages.

## Limits

- **Nothing is ever unloaded.** Every system a plugin registered is a function pointer into its image, and a Bevy schedule holds those for the life of the `App`. Unmapping the image turns them into dangling pointers, so a reload leaks the old one (a few hundred KB) and a restart reclaims it.
- **Loading is synchronous.** A stale plugin rebuilds during app assembly, holding startup for about a second each.
- **No undo integration yet.** A plugin can mutate the World freely but cannot push onto the editor's undo stack — that lives outside the contract crate.
- **A plugin can crash the editor.** A panic while constructing or during load is caught; a segfault is not. Installing a plugin runs its code, and the source is on disk to read.

## Where to look for examples

**No native plugin ships in the repository.** The ones that used to sit in `plugins/` were scaffolding for bringing the mechanism up and were removed once it worked; `plugins/` now holds only [C-ABI plugins](standalone-plugins.md), which are a different mechanism with a different loader.

That leaves the engine's own crates as the reference, and they are a good one: an in-workspace plugin under `crates/` is an ordinary Bevy plugin with a `renzora::add!` line, and everything inside it — the systems, the resources, the `&mut World` access, the contract-crate calls — is written exactly as a native plugin writes it. The only difference is the one line at the bottom of the file and how it gets linked.

- `crates/renzora_lumen` and `crates/renzora_cloth` are small, self-contained feature plugins.
- The built-in panels are the model for [panel code](panels.md); `crates/renzora_ember/src/widgets/gallery.rs` is the shortest complete example of building a large ember tree from one `build` function.
- `crates/renzora_rust_script` is the same loading mechanism used a second way, if you want to see the host side.

Start from the skeleton at the top of this page rather than from a copied example — it is four lines plus a `Cargo.toml`, and `renzora add <name>` scaffolds it.

## Loose Tier-1 plugins (Phase 3)

Loose Tier-1 plugins share the **same discovery root** as native
plugins (`<exe-dir>/../../plugins`, `<cwd>/plugins`, or
`RENZORA_PLUGIN_SRC`) but are NOT compiled as a Rust workspace crate.
A loose Tier-1 plugin is a single `.rs` file in that root, compiled
against the small `renzora_plugin` C ABI by the editor at runtime.
See [plugins.md](plugins.md#loose-single-file-plugins-phase-3) for
the authoring contract.

Loose Tier-1 plugins are independent of native plugins:

- A directory under `plugins/` with a `Cargo.toml` keeps the existing
  native-plugin build path.
- A loose `.rs` file under `plugins/` follows the Phase 3 loose
  Tier-1 plugin path.

The two do not interact. A loose file does NOT trigger the native
plugin SDK unpack or full-Bevy toolchain probe.
