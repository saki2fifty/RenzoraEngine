# Network backends

The engine ships a networking **API** and no network client. What opens a socket
is a separate C-ABI plugin, exactly the way a mixer or a scripting language is —
see [Audio backends](./audio-backends.md) and
[Script backends](./script-backends.md), whose shape this mirrors deliberately.

Drop `http.dll` (`.so`, `.dylib`) into `plugins/` and the editor can reach the
marketplace. Delete it and the same binary runs offline: nothing panics, no
request hangs, every call reports "no network backend is loaded" and the UI
carries on.

## Optional startup requests

The splash screen waits until the HTTP backend is available before starting its
background GitHub star-count request. Constructing the splash plugin does not
start network work. With no backend the counter remains unavailable; startup
continues normally. Once started, the request is attempted only once and its
result is polled without blocking the editor. This avoids racing the HTTP
watchdog while the editor is still assembling its first frame.

The automatic software-update check also waits for backend readiness. It does
not consume its one automatic attempt while networking is unavailable. Manual
checks and retries in the update dialog remain available. Readiness is not a
guarantee against later stalls: if a frame stops progressing long enough, an
in-flight request can still report the HTTP watchdog error.

## Why HTTP is a plugin and not part of the engine

**It was twenty packages every build paid for.** `ureq` plus the TLS stack under
it — rustls, ring, webpki, the platform certificate verifiers — used to be
compiled by every build of the engine, including a 2D mobile game that never
makes a request. Behind the boundary they are the plugin's dependencies,
compiled once.

**Different platforms need genuinely different implementations.** A browser build
wants `fetch`, where TLS, certificates and the connection pool all come free and
none of it belongs in the wasm blob. A console build wants the platform's own
certified HTTP library — and on some of them, shipping your own is a
certification failure, not a preference. A studio behind a corporate proxy wants
theirs. None of that was expressible while the client was a dependency of the
engine.

## What each side owns

| | |
|---|---|
| **The engine** (`renzora_net`) | the request builder, the blocking facade, the frame pump, the tag bookkeeping, and every decision about *what* to fetch and what the answer means |
| **The backend** (`plugins/http`) | DNS, connect, TLS, headers, reading bodies |

The backend knows nothing about the marketplace, auth tokens, JSON shapes or
retry policy. It moves bytes.

### It must not block

`Backend::start` is called from inside the engine's frame. A backend that
performed the transfer there would stall the editor for a round trip, so the
contract is queue-and-poll: `start` spawns and returns, and `poll` is called once
per frame to collect whatever finished.

The engine layers a *blocking* facade on top for the code that wants one, and it
works by parking the **calling** thread while the frame keeps running. That only
holds together because this side stays asynchronous.

### Capabilities are answered, not assumed

`Backend::init` returns a `Caps` bitfield: `STREAM`, `CANCEL`, `HEADERS`. The
engine will not send a cancellation to a backend that did not claim `CANCEL`, and
it *will* expect a streaming request to arrive in pieces if `STREAM` is set.

Claiming honestly matters. A backend that says it streams and then delivers one
body at the end leaves the AI chat panel waiting for tokens that never come.

### An HTTP error status is not an error

A 404 is a **successful** request whose response says 404. Transport failure —
DNS, connect, TLS, timeout, a read that died mid-body — is `EventKind::Error`,
and nothing else is.

This is load-bearing rather than pedantic. renzora.com answers a failed call with
`{"error": "asset name already taken"}` and a 400; a client that turned the
status into an error would throw that body away, and the editor would show "HTTP
400". It used to.

## Using it from the engine

```rust
use renzora_net::Request;

// On a background thread — never from a system, see below.
let assets: Vec<Asset> = Request::get(&url)
    .maybe_bearer(token.as_deref())
    .send()?
    .json()?;
```

`Response::json` treats a non-2xx as an error and surfaces the server's own
`{"error": …}` message, falling back to `HTTP <status>`. `Response::text` and
`Response::body` are there for everything else — the body is `Vec<u8>` because
half the callers are fetching PNGs.

Streaming, for a token-by-token chat reply:

```rust
let mut stream = Request::post(&endpoint).json(&payload).send_stream()?;
for chunk in &mut stream {
    print!("{}", chunk.text());
}
if let Some(e) = stream.error() { /* died halfway */ }
```

Chunks are whatever each read returned, so a frame can straddle two of them. The
transport is deliberately dumb about framing — NDJSON and SSE end a frame
differently — so a consumer that parses lines must reassemble them across chunk
boundaries. `renzora_ai_chat` is the worked example.

### Never call `fetch` from a system

A system runs inside the frame the pump needs in order to make progress, so
blocking there waits for something that cannot happen until you return. You get
`Error::NoPump` after two seconds rather than a hang — but the fix is to spawn a
thread, or use the `HttpInbox` pattern in `renzora_scripting`.

When the watchdog ends a blocking or streaming request, the caller's pending
storage is released. Requests still waiting for the pump are removed rather than
sent later. For requests already handed over, the pump asks the backend to cancel
when frames resume, if it supports `Caps::CANCEL`. Cancellation cannot undo a
request already processed by the server; a backend without cancellation may
finish the transfer, but late responses are discarded. Dropping an unfinished
stream uses the same cleanup. Completed requests are not cancelled.

## Writing one

```rust
use renzora_plugin::net::*;
use renzora_plugin::prelude::*;

#[derive(Default)]
struct MyClient { /* … */ }

impl Backend for MyClient {
    const NAME: &'static str = "my_client";

    fn init(&mut self) -> Result<BackendInfo, String> { /* build a client */ }
    fn start(&mut self, request: &Request, body: &[u8]) -> Result<(), String> { /* spawn */ }
    fn poll(&mut self) -> Vec<Event> { /* drain */ }
    // `shutdown` and `cancel` have defaults
}

renzora_plugin::net_backend!(MyClient);

pub struct MyHttpPlugin;
impl Plugin for MyHttpPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_net_backend(net_backend::desc());
    }
}
renzora_plugin::add!(MyHttpPlugin);
```

Three required methods.

**One backend loads.** Two scripting languages coexist because a script picks one
by its file extension; a request carries no such key, and splitting a session's
cookies and connection pool across two clients would break both. The host keeps
the first registration and logs the second.

## Ops, not one function pointer per operation

A backend registers a single `extern "C"` entry point and the operation is
selected by a `NetOp` code — `Init`, `Shutdown`, `Start`, `Poll`, `Cancel`. A
backend that does not recognise one returns `NetStatus::UnknownOp`, and the
engine treats that exactly as it treats a capability that backend never claimed.
Appending an op is a `VERSION_MINOR` bump and nothing stops working.

`add_net_backend` was appended to the interface in **ABI MINOR 4.10**.

### This is not the `renzora.http` service

The two are the same protocol pointed in opposite directions, and it is worth
being clear about which is which:

| | direction | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `renzora_plugin::http` | a plugin asks the **engine** to fetch | rides `CommandKind::Service`, costs no table entry |
| `renzora_plugin::net` | the **engine** asks a plugin to fetch | an `Interface` entry, because the engine needs the answer back |

Both exist, and they compose: a plugin's `http_get` reaches the host, which hands
it straight back out to whichever plugin registered as the network backend.

## The bundled backend

`plugins/http` is the native one: `ureq`, with rustls underneath. One worker
thread per request — the engine's traffic peaks at a marketplace page and the
dozen thumbnails on it, each dominated by waiting on a socket, so a pool would
bound that arbitrarily for no gain.

Two things worth knowing about it:

- **`http_status_as_error(false)`.** Without it `ureq` turns a 4xx into an `Err`
  and the response body goes with it, which is the behaviour the section above
  exists to prevent.
- **`max_bytes` is enforced as the body arrives**, not after. The callers that
  set it are fetching images from URLs a server chose — a thumbnail, an avatar,
  an image in a README — and a cap applied once the bytes are in memory protects
  nothing.

## What is not covered yet

**WebSockets.** Nothing in the engine opens one any more. The only live
connection was the social layer's, and it was deleted along with the feed,
messages and friends panels — which took `tungstenite`, rustls and ring out of
the dependency graph with it. A backend that wants one still has nowhere to put
it: adding a `Send` op with `Open`/`Message`/`Close` event kinds would be
append-only and break no ABI, but there is no longer a caller asking for it.

**Game replication.** `renzora_network` stays where it is, deliberately. It is
per-frame, latency-critical and high-frequency; routing every packet through a
once-a-frame poll, a wire codec and an FFI hop would cost a frame of latency and
a copy per packet. It wants a ring buffer, not a request queue.
