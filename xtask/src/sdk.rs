//! `cargo renzora sdk` — stage the compile-time half of a plugin build.
//!
//! A marketplace plugin ships as Rust source and is compiled on the machine that
//! installs it, against the engine that is already there. For that to work the
//! user needs what `rustc` reads at compile time, which is emphatically *not*
//! what the editor needs at run time:
//!
//!   * `dist/<platform>/` holds the **code** — `bevy_dylib`, `renzora_dylib`,
//!     `std`. Loaded when the editor starts. Staged by [`crate::stage`].
//!   * `dist/sdk-<triple>/` holds the **blueprints** — `.rmeta` crate metadata,
//!     proc-macro dylibs, native import libraries. Read by `rustc`, never
//!     loaded. Staged here.
//!
//! The two cannot be merged. Linking a dylib discards the metadata of everything
//! it swallowed: `renzora_dylib.dll` carries `renzora_dylib`'s own metadata and
//! nothing else, so a compiler pointed at it alone cannot even resolve `Query`.
//! Measured the other way round too — a plugin that reads a 39 MB `bevy_ecs`
//! rlib links to 0.29 MB, because only the metadata half is consumed.
//!
//! # Why `.rmeta` and not `.rlib`
//!
//! That last measurement is the whole argument. An `.rlib` is an `ar` archive of
//! exactly two things: `lib.rmeta`, the crate's metadata, and the object code
//! `rustc` produced for it. A plugin build consumes only the first — it
//! typechecks against the metadata and takes the *code* from the three shared
//! images (`bevy_dylib`, `renzora_dylib`, `renzora_ember_dylib`), which is the
//! point of them existing. The object half is dead weight in this directory:
//! 3325 MB of staged rlib against 1492 MB of the metadata inside it.
//!
//! So [`metadata_only`] swaps each `.rlib` cargo names for the sibling `.rmeta`
//! cargo emitted for the same unit. Both filenames carry the same `-C metadata`
//! hash, so the pairing is exact by construction rather than by matching names —
//! this is not the directory scan the section below forbids.
//!
//! Verified rather than assumed: every native plugin in `plugins/` compiles and
//! links against a metadata-only SDK, and the resulting library is byte-identical
//! to the rlib-built one apart from the PE timestamp — measured at 16 differing
//! bytes out of 408 576 on a panel plugin.
//!
//! # Why dropping the object half is sound, and where it stops being sound
//!
//! `rustc` gives every crate in the link closure a linkage. Under
//! `-C prefer-dynamic`, a crate whose object code is **already inside a dylib
//! being linked** is included from that dylib and needs no archive; anything
//! else falls to static linkage, which demands an `.rlib` and says so —
//! `error[E0461]: crate 'X' required to be available in rlib format`. There is
//! no silent path: a crate that needed its objects and lost them is a hard
//! error naming the crate.
//!
//! Staged metadata is sound because all 950 of these crates are inside
//! `bevy_dylib`, `renzora_dylib` or `renzora_ember_dylib`. That is what those
//! images ARE.
//!
//! # The one crate that keeps its `.rlib`
//!
//! `bevy` — the facade a plugin is handed by `--extern` — is the exception, and
//! it is subtle enough to be worth the 42 KB.
//!
//! The facade is not inside `bevy_dylib`; that image holds `bevy_internal` and
//! below. It IS inside `renzora_dylib`, which was built against the facade rlib
//! and swallowed it. So a plugin that touches `renzora` links `renzora_dylib`
//! and resolves `bevy` through it — which is why a metadata-only `bevy` compiled
//! every real plugin here.
//!
//! But the dylib has to be *used*, not merely offered: an unused `--extern` is
//! not linked and contributes nothing. A plugin importing `bevy` and nothing
//! else therefore failed E0461 with a metadata-only facade, where an `.rlib`
//! builds it fine (both measured).
//!
//! Such a plugin cannot actually load — `renzora::plugin!` writes the ctor
//! symbol the loader looks for, and the macro alone is enough to pull the image
//! in (measured) — so this was a build error on the way to a library that would
//! have been skipped anyway. It is still a worse error than no error, and the
//! `.rlib` is 42 576 bytes against the `.rmeta`'s 41 784. Paying 792 bytes to
//! keep the rule "everything a plugin is *given* stays whole; everything it
//! reaches *through* those is metadata" is the better trade.
//!
//! # Why it is staged on every build
//!
//! An SDK only works against the engine it was cut from. Every metadata
//! filename carries a `-C metadata` hash of the build configuration, and
//! `renzora_dylib` changes whenever the contract crate does — so a stale SDK
//! beside a fresh editor produces plugins that fail to link, or worse, link
//! against a mismatched image. Staging it alongside the binaries is what makes
//! "stale" a state that cannot occur locally.
//!
//! That is affordable only because the files are **hardlinked**, not copied.
//! `target/` and `dist/` sit on one volume, so ~1050 links cost no disk and
//! effectively no time; a plain copy of 1.9 GB on every build would not be
//! tolerable. `link_or_copy` falls back to copying if the link fails, which is
//! what happens when someone puts `dist/` on another drive.
//!
//! A release does not ship this tree as-is. `scripts/package-release.sh`
//! compresses it to a single `sdk.tar.zst` (~444 MB) beside the executables and
//! deletes the extracted copy, so the download carries one file rather than
//! 1.9 GB of loose metadata. Bundling it rather than hosting a separate download
//! is deliberate: it removes a whole subsystem (a URL, progress, resume,
//! checksums, offline) and makes a version mismatch structurally impossible,
//! since the SDK in the folder is by construction the one that built the editor
//! next to it.
//!
//! `cargo renzora sdk` regenerates only this part when that is all you want.
//!
//! # Why the file list comes from cargo and never from a directory scan
//!
//! `target/dist/deps/` holds many `-C metadata` variants of the same crate — two
//! `ash`, two `windows`, six `hashbrown` — left by different feature
//! resolutions. Picking "the newest of each name" out of that directory produces
//! a set that looks complete, compresses, ships, and then **fails to compile**,
//! because the variants are from different generations and their metadata
//! disagrees. That is not hypothetical; it is what happened the first time this
//! was attempted here, and the same bug is recorded in the staging code of
//! another engine that took this approach.
//!
//! So the list is read from `cargo build --message-format=json`, whose
//! `compiler-artifact` lines name the exact files this build produced. That is
//! the only source that is right by construction.
