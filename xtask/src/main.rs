//! `cargo renzora` — native build + stage + run, the local mirror of Docker.
//!
//! Docker gives a contributor two things: a pinned toolchain (so everyone
//! compiles with the same rustc) and a build that arranges the output into a
//! runnable `dist/` layout. The toolchain pin is handled by `rust-toolchain.toml`
//! (rustup auto-selects 1.95.0). This binary handles the second half WITHOUT a
//! container, for the host platform only:
//!
//!   1. `cargo build --profile dist --workspace` — compile BOTH executables
//!      (`renzora`, the runtime/shipped game, and `renzora-editor`) plus every
//!      distribution plugin cdylib. One invocation: the ~700 shared crates
//!      compile once and are linked into both binaries.
//!   2. Stage `dist/<platform>/`: the two executables + the shared libraries +
//!      the OpenXR loader beside each other, every plugin cdylib into `plugins/`.
//!   3. (`run` only) launch the staged editor.
//!
//! ## The shared libraries
//!
//! `renzora_app`'s default features include `dynamic_linking`, so Bevy lives in
//! one `bevy_dylib` that both executables import rather than a private copy
//! baked into each. Measured on Windows, that took the pair from 460 MB to
//! 397 MB, and it takes relinking the whole of Bevy out of every build.
//!
//! It is also the prerequisite for a plugin ever holding `&mut World`: Rust
//! derives a type's `TypeId` from how it was compiled, so two independently
//! linked copies of Bevy disagree about what `Transform` is. One shared image
//! means one answer.
//!
//! Two files therefore have to land beside the executables, and a missing one
//! is not a clean error — the OS loader refuses the binary before `main`:
//!
//!   * `bevy_dylib.<ext>`, from `target/dist/`.
//!   * `std-<hash>.<ext>`, from the rustc sysroot. This one is easy to forget
//!     because nothing in the workspace asks for it: linking *any* dylib makes
//!     rustc link std dynamically too, so it arrives as a side effect of
//!     `dynamic_linking` rather than of `prefer-dynamic` (which this repo does
//!     not set). The filename hashes the toolchain, so it must be re-staged
//!     whenever `rust-toolchain.toml` moves.
//!
//! The editor is still a second *executable* rather than the removable
//! `renzora_editor.dll` it used to be. That is unrelated to the above and has
//! not changed: `renzora_viewport::external_runtime` spawns `renzora` as a child
//! process for play mode, so both binaries must be staged together regardless.
//!
//! Why a staging step at all: a bare `cargo run` leaves the plugin cdylibs flat
//! in `target/dist/` next to the exe, but the dynamic loader scans
//! `<exe-dir>/plugins/` — so those plugins compile but never load. Step 2 is the
//! one thing `cargo run` can't do, and the only reason `cargo renzora` exists.
//!
//! Cross-platform builds stay Docker-only (`renzora build` / `build-all.sh`):
//! this tool only ever produces artifacts for the machine it runs on.
