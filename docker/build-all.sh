# Build engine targets — run inside the renzora per-platform toolchain containers
# =============================================================================
#
# Usage: ./scripts/build-all.sh <output-dir> [platform ...]
#
# Each target (editor, runtime) is built in isolation with its own
# feature flag and target directory. No feature unification, no hash mixing.
# The dedicated server is not a separate target — it's the runtime launched
# with `--server`.
#
# ── What this script produces: runtimes, not desktop editors ─────────────────
# The output of a desktop lane is a RUNTIME — the game binary that
# `renzora_export` uses as that platform's export template. The editor binary is
# compiled and then not staged, because an editor carries a plugin SDK and an
# SDK cannot be cross-built: its proc-macro dylibs are artifacts of the machine
# running the compiler, so a Linux container can only ever produce Linux ones.
# See the long note in `build_desktop`.
#
# So the three ways to build divide cleanly:
#
#   cargo renzora     your own platform, complete, editor and SDK included
#   this script       runtimes / export templates, every platform, no editor
#   CI native lanes   the published editors, one runner per platform
#
# The wasm lane is the exception that proves it: a wasm editor has no SDK and
# compiles no Rust at runtime, so it is still built here.
#
# ── Per-platform toolchain images ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The toolchain is split into one image per platform (base + linux
# / windows / macos / ios / android / wasm).
# The `renzora` CLI runs THIS script once inside each requested platform's
# container with that platform's arg, so only that platform's toolchain is
# present. This script needs no per-image awareness: it already filters by the
# platform arg and degrades gracefully when a toolchain is absent (osxcross /
# NDK / the linux cross marker are simply not there in the wrong container, so
# those guards no-op). Passing several platform args still works within a single
# container that happens to carry several toolchains (e.g. a local full image).
#
# Platforms (positional args after <output-dir>; pass none to build all):
#   linux        Linux, native container arch (x86_64 or arm64)
#   windows      Windows x86_64 MSVC (xwin)
#   macos        macOS x86_64 + arm64 (osxcross)
#   macos-x64    macOS x86_64 only
#   macos-arm64  macOS arm64 only
#   wasm         WASM game runtime + editor (two bundles under web-wasm32/)
#   android      Android arm64 + x86_64
#   android-arm64
#   android-x86
#   ios          iOS arm64 staticlib
#
# ── Parallelism ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Builds run as concurrent "lanes". The contention-free unit is the FEATURE,
# not the platform: editor/runtime each use their own `--target-dir`
# (target/editor, target/runtime), while every desktop platform
# for one feature shares that dir (different triple subdirs inside it). So we
# run one lane per feature, plus one each for wasm / android / ios. Lanes never
# share a target-dir, so cargo's per-target-dir build lock never serialises
# them — and the on-disk cache layout is identical to a sequential build.
#
# Within a feature lane, desktop platforms still build sequentially (they share
# that feature's target-dir and reuse its host-side proc-macro/build-script
# artifacts), exactly as before — only the lanes themselves overlap.
#
# Concurrency is capped by BUILD_JOBS (env). Default is derived from container
# memory (~4 GB per concurrent lane) and clamped to the CPU count, because the
# real ceiling on parallel bevy builds is RAM during codegen/link, not cores.
# On a memory-tight machine, set BUILD_JOBS=1 or 2. On a big build server, set
# it as high as the lane count (6) to overlap everything.

# ── Which cargo profile the ENGINE is built with ─────────────────────────
# `release` (size-optimised: opt-level "s" + thin LTO), not `dist`, which is the
# fast-link profile a contributor iterates with. The two exist precisely so that
# shipping can be slow and small while local builds stay fast — see the profile
# comments in the root Cargo.toml.
#
# The cargo profile name doubles as the target-dir subdirectory, so this one
# variable moves both. Overridable (RENZORA_PROFILE=dist) to reproduce a lane
# quickly without waiting for LTO.
#
# NOTE: `plugins/*` and `tools/updater` are deliberately NOT built with it. Each
# is its own cargo workspace with its own tuned `[profile.dist]`, and their
# outputs are kilobytes — nothing to gain, a target-dir rename to lose.
PROFILE="${RENZORA_PROFILE:-release}"
# Exported so anything this script shells out to selects the same profile by
# name instead of falling back to its own default. That mattered acutely while
# the SDK was staged here — an unexported value had a `release` lane invoke an
# xtask that rebuilt the entire workspace under `dist` and then described a
# compilation no shipped binary came from — and it is kept because agreeing on
# one profile is cheap and disagreeing is expensive.

# NOTE: staging `std-<hash>.{dll,so,dylib}` lives in `copy_shared_libs` above.
# It was deleted from here when Bevy went static, on the reasoning that nothing
# was left to share a std with. `dynamic_linking` is back in the default features
# and brings `-C prefer-dynamic` with it, so the executables import a hashed std
# again and it has to ship. The cost that argument named — a toolchain-versioned
# import under a hashed filename — is real and is simply the price of the shared
# images.

# ── Compress the staged executables with UPX ─────────────────────────────────
# Usage: compress_binaries <platform-name> <exe-suffix>
#
# UPX packs an executable and prepends a decompressor stub, so the shipped file
# unpacks itself into memory at launch. Measured on the `dist` runtime:
# **187.3 MB -> 31.7 MB, an 83% saving**, and the packed binary boots through the
# full plugin and scripting startup — nothing about Bevy's startup or the
# dlopen'd plugins minds a decompressor stub.
#
# `--best --lzma`, not `--brute`: MEASURED on the 187 MB runtime, the two produce
# a **byte-for-byte identical** file (33,363,456 bytes) — `--brute` took 1529 s,
# `--best --lzma` took ~100 s. `--lzma` already pins UPX's strongest compressor,
# and for an amd64 PE the filter space `--brute` additionally explores has
# nothing better to find. (Measured on PE only; ELF/Mach-O were not compared.)
#
# ── What is deliberately NOT packed ──────────────────────────────────────────
# * `renzora-update` — the update sidecar. It is the thing that repairs a broken
#   install; making it the one binary with an extra layer of machinery between
#   the OS loader and `main` is precisely the wrong trade. It is 320 KB anyway.
# * `plugins/*` — 68 libraries totalling ~15 MB against 450 MB of executables, so
#   the win is noise, and packing a `dlopen`ed library is the least-tested UPX

    # ── The binaries ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # The workspace has two executables:
    #
    #   renzora         the runtime / shipped game (package `renzora_app`)
    #   renzora-editor  the editor              (package `renzora_editor_app`)
    #
    # This script stages the RUNTIME only. It never ships an editor.
    #
    # `renzora-editor` is compiled here (the lane builds `--workspace`) and then
    # deliberately left behind, because a container cannot produce a *usable*
    # editor for anything but its own Linux architecture, and it should not
    # produce a half-usable one for everything else.
    #
    # The reason is the plugin SDK. An editor compiles native plugins and Rust
    # scripts on the machine it runs on, so it ships the metadata and the
    # proc-macro dylibs `rustc` needs. Proc macros run *inside* the compiler, so
    # they are built for the host — and cross-compiling here means that host is
    # Linux. Ship that to a Windows or macOS user and their `rustc` cannot load
    # half of it: `can't find crate for bevy_derive`, and with it every name
    # behind `bevy::prelude`. Nor can the mismatch be patched afterwards; each
    # `.rmeta` records the hash of what it was compiled against, so the metadata
    # and the proc macros have to come out of one build on one machine whose own
    # platform is the platform being built for.
    #
    # That is not fixable in a cross-compiler, so the job moved instead:
    #
    #   cargo renzora     your own platform, complete, with a working SDK
    #   this script       runtime templates, any platform, no editor
    #   CI native lanes   editors, one runner per platform
    #
    # Nothing is lost. A game needs no SDK — it ships plugins already compiled —
    # so cross-built runtimes are correct, which is exactly what the export
    # templates in `renzora_export` are. And the editor for the machine you are
    # sitting at never wanted a container in the first place.
    #
    # The bundle wrappers below already expect this: `AppRun` and the `.app`'s
    # CFBundleExecutable both fall back to `renzora` when no editor binary is
    # present, so an AppImage/.app still forms and `TemplateManager::scan` still
    # finds the runtime inside it.
